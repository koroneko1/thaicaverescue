Well, the Air Force has provided us
with tents, tables, and chairs,

The rain has leveled off.
Why would the water surge now?

119
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,248
It's not sudden.

120
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,331
It's been building towards it
since the rain started.

121
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,956
I ran the calculations all morning.

122
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,036
The rate of flow inside the cave,
with the rate of rainfall outside,

123
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,575
given the makeup of the mountain,
granite on the northern side of the border

124

forcing all the water
to the southern side. <i>This</i> side.

Which is limestone.
It's like a giant sponge.

126

When a sponge is oversaturated,
the water spills out.

-[Bhak] Point of no return.

132

When the water passes that red tape,

133
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,420
it'll seal the interior passages,

134
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,540
the sumps beyond the T-junction,

135
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,375
the chambers will begin to fill.

136
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,418
There will be no place
for the divers to stop between sumps.

137
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,630
It will be too dangerous
to dive in or out.

In a normal year, when would the cave
become passable again?

October.

00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,251
"Be patient and strong."

340
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,541
"We believe in you."

341
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:14,955
"You can make it."

342
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,456
"Your pa really loves
and misses you a lot."

343
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,961
"Yours, Ma."

344
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,421
[boys shouting and taunting]

345
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Hey, pal. Sounds like somebody loves ya.

346
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,753
[all laughing]

347
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,333
Hey, Coach Eak. What's up?

348
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,131
Tell me, is there more?

349
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,748
"We want you to thank Coach Eak

350
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:46,206
because he has been able
to keep all you boys safe all this time."

351
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,578
"And we're not angry with him."

352
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,666
But why would they be angry?

353
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,876
It certainly isn't Eak's fault
that we're all stuck in here.

354
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,998
[talking excitedly]

355
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,253
-[Adul] Can I see? Come on.
-[Note] Hey, give me mine.

356
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,083
-Move, please.
-[boys chattering]

357
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,456
Where's mine?

358
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,418
[boys murmuring]

359
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,671
[Mix] No, no, no--
Ah, no, that's not mine.

360
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,421
[Dom] Hey! Get off me!

361
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,790
I'm getting up!

362
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,455
-[Night] Wait, gimme mine!
-What's the problem, Dom?

363
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,498
[Night] I can't-- Oh no, wait.

364
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:28,463
I was just hoping I'd get a hot dog.
With mayonnaise.

365
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,881
[boys continue talking impatiently]

366
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:35,786
Dom!

367
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,786
I was about to hit the water.
How 'bout you join me?

368
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:45,826
Fine, then.

369
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,576
Let's go! Whoo!

370
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,038
Aha!

371
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,578
Follow me!

372
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,208
Oh! Whoo!

373
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,670
[whoops excitedly]

374
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:58,825
[whoops]

375
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:07,128
I don't recommend it.
Now I'm freezing my butt off.

376
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,208
[boys laughing]

377
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,878
[shouts playfully]

378
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,208
[boys laughing]

379
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,921
[boys chattering excitedly]

380
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,375
[Noi] Governor!

381
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,125
[Narongsak] Ah, Noi.

382
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,250
I'm glad you took my advice
and got some rest.

383
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,793
You owe me one.

384
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,075
I wasted my opportunity to write to Dom.

385
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,536
You told us earlier that there was
nothing to gain by remaining here.

386
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,996
Everyone else got to send a message
to their kids.

387
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,963
Dom is the only child that hasn't received
a letter from his family.

388
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,626
Dear Noi, I'm sorry.

389
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,328
Governor, you have to send a diver.

390
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:54,495
Could you send a diver in again
and let him deliver my letter to Dom?

391
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,173
I understand your feelings, but

392
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,880
it's…

393
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,628
the timing is terrible.

394
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,668
Listen, our Dom's alone in there.

395
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,040
We can't allow him to worry.

396
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,625
We've got to tell him
that all of us are here.

397
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,538
It's not me that's against it.

398
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,626
I-- I just can't.

399
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,001
Just what are you saying?

400
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,828
[Narongsak] The last group of SEALs
has returned just now.

401
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,828
The water is flooding the cave entrance.

402
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,246
I just can't send anyone in.

403
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,580
Not now.

404
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,326
At least not for the moment.

405
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,126
The cave entrance
is sealed off by the flood.

406
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,041
[Noi] <i>What does this mean for my nephew?</i>

407
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,213
This way.

408
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:21,418
[Kelly] I've reviewed all the maps
Vern has of the cave and chambers

409
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
and where the water
usually flows from and to

410
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,963
and compared that
to the satellite imagery.

411
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:27,915
This, right here,

412
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,830
is the location of the falls
that I believe is the major source

413
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,786
feeding water into the Monk's Series.

414
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:36,826
This stream runs straight to the falls
and into Luang Cave.

415
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,126
If we dam it with the sandbags,

416
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,538
we can divert all the water
to the stream here,

417
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:45,423
running to our right,
and southwest down to Myanmar.

418
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,210
That's far from Luang Cave.

419
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:50,921
Then we stand a chance of controlling
the water table inside the cave.

420
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,130
[Pim] Do you really think
it's that simple?

421
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:56,168
I've seen mountain springs
disappear in one place

422
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,790
only to reappear
meters away the next winter.

423
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:02,075
Do you really <i>think</i>
you can control nature with sandbags?

424
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:05,876
I've seen sandbags hold back
hurricane flooding in the States.

425
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,328
It works.

426
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,833
[suspenseful music playing]

427
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,826
[Luke] Governor,
I went looking for a faster way,

428
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,456
but I've never seen anything like this.

429
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:26,001
And Jirasak here came highly recommended

430
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,253
by the DSS engineers at the embassy.

431
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,503
He brought a hell of a shortcut with him.

432
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,830
Essentially, we'll create
a small sound quake inside the cave,

433
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:38,496
which will help us pinpoint the areas
of the cave holding the most water.

434
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,583
Like the chamber where the boys are?

435
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:44,923
Yes, they will be the widest
and easiest to drill into.

436
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,540
We just have to find them.

437
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:49,785
Imagine you put a pebble
on the floor of this tent.

438
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:53,125
And you drill through the roof
<i>hoping</i> you would hit the pebble.

439
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,328
Jirasak here can find the pebble

440
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:58,416
from outside the tent,
so we know exactly where to drill.

441
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,710
The boys need every chance they can get.

442
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:04,541
You, continue the search.

443
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,580
Good luck.

444
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:17,291
[soldier] Here.

445
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,250
Here's another one.

446
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,535
[Kelly] All right.

447
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,460
I'll take measurements tonight
on both sides of the dam,

448
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:51,041
run the calculations,
and again in the morning.

449
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:54,245
It'll tell me if we're diverting
enough water per square meter.

450
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:57,463
Then we can assume that the levels
in the cave have stabilized.

451
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:58,381
[gadget pings]

452
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,125
[gadget beeping]

453
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:11,883
When you've got your reading,
you should come down to camp.

454
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,918
The bears come down to the water at night.

455
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,210
This area is called "Pha Mee."

456
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,253
"Mee" translates to "bear."

457
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,083
You know that, right?

458
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,920
I do now.

459
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
[tense music playing]

460
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,041
[Jirasak] <i>The sound quakes are working.</i>

461
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,535
<i>We just need more and louder waves</i>
<i>to register the negative spaces.</i>

462
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:12,035
[Luke] Incredible.
It's like a 3D x-ray of the mountain.

463
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,791
But we need a higher resolution image.

464
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,040
-We need a--
-Harder hit?

465
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:18,961
-Mm-hmm.
-Stand by.

466
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:29,671
[computer bleeps]

467
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,750
[Jirasak] We got it!

468
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,171
[man] Get over here.
He's climbing back up!

469
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:45,918
-[soldier 1] All coming down.
-[soldier 2] Better hurry up.

470
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,036
Could he climb all the way down?

471
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:52,128
At the moment, he can't get past
the point that's too narrow.

472
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:55,128
He says he just might make it
if he leaves his gear behind.

473
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,378
[Tobias speaking German]

474
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,830
[speaking in German]

475
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,583
[in English] The water down there
is too deep,

476
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:07,876
and without safety gear,
it's too big a risk.

477
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
The only way in is without gear.

478
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:13,173
[Sean] What if we drill to widen the hole?

479
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:16,916
[Jirasak] He's suggesting that we drill.

480
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:24,041
But the logistics necessary to make that
happen in the middle of the jungle…

481
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:28,035
We need to bring it up with a helicopter.
Clear a place for it to land.

482
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:30,325
My men can clear an LZ, not a problem.

483
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:32,456
I'll land that helo on a Thai baht.

484
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:35,495
All right. Let's go!

Say your prayers and think of us."

683
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,285
And this dragon pump,

684
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:03,253
<i>can you keep the water levels this low,</i>

685
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:06,173
<i>so we can dive and reach the boys?</i>

686
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,500
If the rain stays steady,

687
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:10,633
yes.

688
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,460
We owe you both a huge debt.

689
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:17,423
Thank you.

690
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:20,246
Thank you.

691
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:28,131
These three days
have made one thing clear.

692
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:31,208
We can't drill the boys out.

693
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,670
The only way out for the boys

694
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,040
is the same way they went in.

695
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:41,705
So…

696
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,130
we need a new rescue plan.

697
