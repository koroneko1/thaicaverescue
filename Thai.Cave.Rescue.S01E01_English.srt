Phong!

331
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,461
Am I not loud enough for you?

332
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,131
[laughs] I heard you.
My way's just easier.

333
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,246
Phong!

334
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,671
You wanna play on this team, don't you?

335
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,960
Then why don't you start
listening to Coach Eak?

336
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,418
You set back up
and do it the way you were told, okay?

337
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,876
[football whistle toots]

338
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:31,963
[Nop] Look.

339
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,251
I know you care

340
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,788
about every one of those boys.

341
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,745
They're like the little brothers
I never had.

342
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,538
[Nop] Well,

343
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,625
they don't need brothers.

344
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,963
They've got each other for that.

345
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,376
You have to be more than that.

346
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,750
Shape them and guide them.

347
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,713
Make the tough calls

348
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,418
when no one else will.

349
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,253
Being their brother on its own
just isn't enough.

350
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,880
When your father died,

351
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,378
you needed someone
to take his place, didn't you?

352
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,920
The abbot was a father figure to you
at the monastery.

353
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,460
Now you can pass it on
by doing the same for those boys.

354
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,246
Got it?

355
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,170
Anyway, I've gotta go.
I've got my daughter's recital.

356
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,670
You'll be just fine.

357
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,171
I'm not gonna let you down.

358
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,918
I'm not the one
you're gonna lose sleep over.

359
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,383
Excuse me. This way, Governor.

360
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,828
-All right, yes.
-Follow me.

361
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,958
Am I being forced to transfer?

362
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,833
We've known one another for years.

363
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,825
I'll be completely honest with you.

364
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,706
They asked for honest and reliable.

365
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,918
Somebody like you.

366
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,130
To help out in Phayao.

367
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,128
Chiang Rai doesn't want reliable?

368
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:32,705
Huh?

369
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,460
Was moving all the way here
from Bangkok not enough for you?

370
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:41,168
Honestly, Phayao isn't even that far
from here to begin with.

371
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,920
Your daughters don't even
have to change schools.

372
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,500
You can see them on weekends.

373
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,083
Have fun. Shopping. Eat out.

374
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:50,785
Straightforward.

375
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,245
[Narongsak sighs]

376
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,503
[Kiattisak groans]

377
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,673
Don't complicate things now.

378
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:02,416
The ministry expects that you will bring
what you brought in Chiang Rai to Phayao.

379
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,830
If not even more.

380
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:04,916
That's all.

381
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,421
Don't overthink it.

382
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,921
[clicking, whirring]

383
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:21,416
You're kidding! Boss said forget it.
How come you're still trying?

384
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Him not wanting paperwork
doesn't mean I'm gonna ignore it.

385
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,543
-People could be in trouble.
-[man 1] Mm. Mm.

386
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,670
We've gotta track
the weather up there in real time.

387
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,380
-How do we do that?
-[Noon sighs]

388
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,378
What did people used to do
before they had satellites?

389
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,788
Don't think they did
much of anything. [scoffs]

390
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,381
-Yeah.
-Dude. Hey, stop it.

391
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,460
You could drive up there yourself.

392
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:47,671
Right? I'm gonna drive 12 whole hours
to check out Myanmar's weather.

393
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,380
[man 2] Consider it a road trip.

394
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,788
-[man 1] Let's all go. [laughs]
-[man 2] Sure.

395
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,745
[sighs] It's impossible to think
with you two around.

396
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,131
[huffs]

397
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:02,666
[woman] Night!

398
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,878
Night, you forgot your water bottle.

399
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,630
-Thank you.
-Go on. Take a drink. Come on.

400
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,710
So what kind of birthday cake
did you want for tonight?

401
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:15,633
You choose whatever.

402
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,538
[Mom] If you let me choose the cake,

403
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,460
then you're getting SpongeBob
this time too.

404
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:23,671
Oh, please tell me you're joking?
Mom, I'm not a little kid.

405
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:28,538
Once we're done, I'm gonna come home early
to help you set up.

406
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,955
Weren't you going somewhere
with your friends?

407
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:34,383
[Night] We were going to go to Pla Cave.

408
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,458
It's apparently closed, though.

409
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,791
Either way, you can still hang out. Hmm?

410
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,375
It's your day.

411
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,788
[clicks tongue] Have fun.

412
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,955
You're aging off the team.
You won't see them much anymore.

413
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,791
[Mom] Yes, it's your last year
on the team.

414
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:51,875
So go have fun with them while you can.
I'll take care of everything. Come on!

415
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,625
Have fun, Son! See you!

416
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:55,955
[woman] Titan!

417
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,883
-[man] Hey, Son!
-[woman] Mom's over here, Titan!

418
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,995
Titan!

419
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,923
-[Eak] Assemble, everyone!
-[football whistle blows]

420
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,710
[Eak] Hurry up.

421
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,041
Come on, Titan.

422
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,375
Red, you're kicking off.
On the bench, Nick and Tle first.

423
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,078
-[both] Sure.
-Note, goalkeeper.

424
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,786
Boon-Nam, grab a jersey.
You're playing with blue today.

425
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,501
Wait a minute. Why me?

426
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:23,793
Well, each team has 13 players.
That's double unlucky.

427
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,875
So that means we need to share our luck
with the other team.

428
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:29,378
We clear? Yut, goalkeeping blue today.

429
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,668
-Sure.
-Okay. Tee?

430
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,000
-Yeah?
-Come on.

431
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,253
One, two, three!

432
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,963
[all] Wild Boars! Hey!

433
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,921
-[Tee] Let's do this!
-[boys shout excitedly]

434
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,380
-[Titan] I don't wanna do this.
-[Eak] Titan.

435
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,041
What's wrong?

436
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,165
[Titan] Pla Cave's closed.

437
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:47,788
Well, it's not the end of the world.

438
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:48,915
[shouts] Yes, it is!

439
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
[pensive music playing]

440
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,210
[football whistle blows]

441
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,376
[boys shouting, chattering]

442
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,038
[blows whistle]

443
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:22,631
[Tle] Pla Cave's not open.

444
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:25,998
You know what?
Tham Luang Cave is. Come on!

445
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,213
-[Note] What do you think?
-[Mix] We should go. Come on.

446
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:30,041
-[Note] Let's go. Let's do it.
-Really?

447
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:32,955
-[all] Yeah!
-He's relaxed enough. He should study now.

448
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:35,961
He's doing fine.
Just let him go have fun with his friends.

449
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:39,421
[Dad] He's falling behind in school.
Where'd you spend the night?

450
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,500
It doesn't matter!

451
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,576
Please, Tai. It does.

452
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,626
You always let him stay at Eak's house,
instead of home.

453
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:48,788
Hey, without him, we wouldn't
have even known they had a game.

454
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:52,416
You mean he's the one who told you?

455
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:55,631
[Dad] We're Titan's parents. Not Eak.

456
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:58,078
He goes over to Eak's place
because of you!

457
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:00,786
He's our responsibility.
We have to take care of him.

458
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:04,173
[Tai] He's desperate for a father figure
'cause you're a terrible--

459
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,880
Okay. We better get going.

460
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,498
[boys cheering]

461
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:08,883
-[Eak] Tee.
-[Tee] Yes?

462
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,038
-[Eak] You're at the end.
-[Tee] Yes, sir!

463
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,833
-[Eak] Not far.
-[Note] Come on. Go!

464
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,076
[all talking excitedly]

465
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:18,285
[Eak] Don't use your front brake
while you're going downhill.

466
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:24,171
[boys talking excitedly]

467
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:27,541
[Phong] Whoo! Come on! Let's go!

468
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,881
Hey, Boon-Nam. Where you going?

469
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,878
[boy shouting]

470
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:35,328
[Boon-Nam] I can't go with you guys.
My mom told me to come home.

471
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:36,706
You listen to her now?

472
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:40,833
[Boon-Nam] Yeah. But she said
she'd make me cookies if I head home now.

473
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:43,003
Have fun with everyone.

474
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,460
I gotta go.

475
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:46,501
[gentle music playing]

476
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,830
[Tee] Mix!

477
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,875
Can't back out now. Come on!

478
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:53,328
[serene music playing]

479
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,670
-[boy laughing]
-[Note] Let's go!

480
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,670
-[Phong] Let's go, yeah!
-Whoo-hoo!

481
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,080
-[Phong] Let's go, come on!
-[blows a kiss]

482
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:17,501
Whoo-hoo! Chill!

483
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:20,503
Yeah! Come on!

484
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:23,333
-[Tle] Let's go!
-[Phong] Look at the camera, Eak.

485
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,248
[laughs] Come on!

486
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:27,246
Titan! Titan! Titan!

487
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,753
Look at the camera!

488
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,963
-What's wrong?
-[Biw] Come on, wait for me!

489
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:32,713
[Phong] Titan, smile.

490
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:38,251
[Phong whooping] Wait for us!

491
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:45,208
[thunder rumbles]

492
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,960
[Noon] <i>Thirty millimeters? Are you sure?</i>
[man] <i>Yeah.</i>

493
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:51,041
<i>And it's not stopping anytime soon.</i>

494
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:54,253
[Noon] <i>I'll call you back</i>
<i>in a half an hour.</i>

495
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:55,383
And thank you.

496
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:00,131
Hey, guys. Listen up.

497
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,128
[man 1] What's up?

498
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,958
My roommate's ex-boyfriend's uncle
lives out in Pha Mee.

499
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:04,881
[man 2] Okay.

500
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:06,958
It's on the border
between Myanmar and Thailand.

501
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:10,631
-[man 2 scoffs] How do you know that?
-[scoffs] A map! Ever heard of it?

502
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,168
Come on, Noon. Would you just relax?

503
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:16,000
I was on the phone with him just now.
They said they got 30 millimeters of rain.

504
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:16,923
[man 1] Huh?

505
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:22,631
[man 2 gasps softly]

506
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:24,458
If it keeps going at this rate…

507
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:26,246
Man.

508
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,920
You better be sure about this.

509
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,880
There's no second chance for us
if we get fired for this.

510
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:32,788
[man 1] Yeah.

511
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:38,328
Well, then. Call anyone else
you can think of who's living up there.

512
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,376
Do it now.

513
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,540
Maybe your ex-girlfriend's weird uncle.
The one who's related to your aunt?

514
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:45,825
-The one--
-[Noon grunts]

515
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
Just joking.

516
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,460
[thunder rumbles in distance]

517
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,960
[Note] All right, all right!
We're heading to the cave! [whoops]

518
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:00,248
[poignant music playing]

519
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:02,415
[Note] Come on, guys!

520
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,876
[Tee] Come on! Come on! Hurry up!

521
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,960
Let's go!

522
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,541
[boys laughing]

523
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:25,293
[boys talking excitedly]

524
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,750
[boys shouting and laughing]

525
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:38,288
[foreboding music playing]

526
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,706
[Eak] We won't be in there for long.
I'm gonna bring my backpack.

527
00:29:56,791 --> 00:29:59,081
If you don't wanna carry yours,
then leave it.

528
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,626
-Come on.
-[Tee] Yes, Coach.

529
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,205
We'll be back soon anyway.

530
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:04,878
[Eak clears his throat]

531
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,170
Coach, I can't stay.
I already told you about that.

532
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,580
Titan,

533
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:12,541
we'll be right back.

534
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:15,706
An hour tops
and you'll be home in time for tutoring.

535
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:17,251
You're not gonna say sorry to me?

536
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:20,003
You knew I didn't want my parents
to come to the game.

537
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,923
Why did you have to invite them?

538
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,001
[Eak sighs]

539
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:25,455
Okay.

540
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,168
I'm not gonna apologize.

541
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:31,626
They wanted to know you were safe,
so I told them where you'd be.

542
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:35,955
-They came on their own.
-Okay, whatever. It's still 'cause of you!

543
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:38,628
You know how my parents are!

544
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:41,075
[Eak sighs]

545
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:50,288
[Eak] Come here.
Got something to show you.

546
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:51,825
Boys!

547
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:53,288
Come on.

548
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:58,541
[tense string music playing]

549
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:05,076
[Mix] Titan, let's go.

550
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,543
[sacred music playing]

551
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:23,496
Hey, Note. Who's Chao Mae Nang Non?

552
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:26,788
[Note] That's the name
of the vengeful princess

553
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,245
whose spirit still lives in the cave.

554
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:32,173
-[Tle] Oh shit. Why's she vengeful?
-[Note] I don't know.

555
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:34,501
[Eak sighs]

556
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,040
The myth goes that there was a princess
who fell for a stable boy.

557
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:41,126
She got pregnant.

558
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:44,038
Her father, the king,
found out about their relationship.

559
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:46,415
He was furious
and wanted the stable boy dead.

560
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,750
So they ran.

561
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:50,998
They were cornered up in these mountains.

562
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:54,381
The stable boy
was slaughtered in front of her.

563
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,375
She was devastated.

564
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,791
So she hid in a cave.

565
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:03,245
Took a pin to her throat
and committed suicide.

566
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,790
[Note] Crazy.

567
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:10,416
They say if you look carefully,
you can see her

568
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,250
in the shape of the mountains.

569
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,495
It's a reminder.

570
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:17,708
A reminder of pain
that the king was cursed with,

571
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:21,081
so he would never forget
that the duty you have to your family

572
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:22,536
is to love.

573
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,580
We get to choose our family as well.

574
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,170
Like her.

575
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:34,956
She chose to love that boy
until the very end. Right?

576
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:38,376
Her story didn't end well,

577
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,328
but it can for this whole team.

578
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:42,788
You guys are really lucky.

579
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:46,963
You get to decide
what you think about your family.

580
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,208
By your age, I was already an orphan.

581
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:54,125
I didn't have anybody.

582
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:59,286
Taught me to cast a wide net.
To catch somebody.

583
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,001
I hope you will all be there
for each other,

584
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,630
like a family.

585
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:06,288
And I

586
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:08,708
will be here for you

587
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,378
as much as I can be.

588
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,875
I mean it, guys.

589
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,580
Even if you don't understand my methods.

590
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:33,245
Here. Long way to go.
It's prettier inside.

591
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:34,963
Thank you, Coach!

592
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:36,791
[Note] I'll lead you inside.

593
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,880
[Titan] Let's go!

594
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:41,828
[boy shouting excitedly]

595
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:44,376
[yawns]

596
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:46,328
[man] Here's your dinner.

597
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:52,461
[thunder rumbling]

598
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:55,831
[ominous music playing]

599
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,786
[phone ringing]

600
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:20,996
National Park Office.

601
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:23,833
Yes. Hello. This is a check-in
from the TMD in Bangkok.

602
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:25,998
<i>Do you see any clouds?</i>

603
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:29,463
[sighs] Mm, okay.
It's been a very long day.

604
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:32,291
<i>I still have to do paperwork,</i>
<i>so if this isn't an emergency--</i>

605
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:34,535
I just need a minute.
Are there any clouds in the sky?

606
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,380
-Probably. That's where they always are.
-<i>I mean rain clouds. Do you see any?</i>

607
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,963
[sighs impatiently] Hold on.

608
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,455
[sighs softly]

609
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,420
-[disquieting music playing]
-How bad did you say it is?

610
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,580
I didn't. But at Tachiliek and Pha Mee,
we got reports of 30 millimeters an hour.

611
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:01,996
[disquieting music playing]

612
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:05,423
[boys gasping, chattering excitedly]

613
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,708
[Eak] You're being too loud. Follow me.

614
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,250
[disquieting music plays]

615
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:16,923
[Pim] Pha Mee
is only a few miles away from here.

616
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,995
It's coming right for us.

617
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:21,923
Everyone here's gone home already.

618
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:24,378
[Noon] <i>Could you please</i>
<i>measure the rainfall?</i>

619
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:25,705
Could I what?

620
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,496
The monsoon might be here
earlier than we thought.

621
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:32,625
Look, this isn't some kind of joke.

622
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:36,498
<i>You need to issue an alert, and I need it</i>
<i>to authorize closing the park.</i>

623
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:38,543
[Noon] <i>I can't. I'm just an intern.</i>

624
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:42,583
<i>But I need your help with something.</i>

625
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:45,746
<i>If it starts to rain, would you</i>
<i>report the measurements back to me?</i>

626
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:48,673
<i>Then I can bring it to my boss</i>
<i>and ask </i>him<i> to issue an alert.</i>

627
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,000
If you're right
about 30 millimeters per hour,

628
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,503
then that means
you've got no time to spare.

629
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:57,003
You've gotta act immediately.
People are at risk the longer you wait.

630
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,173
I can close the parks and caves,
but without an alert

631
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,380
that won't mean anything.

632
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,708
<i>Do you understand?</i>

633
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:02,631
Yeah.

635
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:16,631
[Noon] Odd! Wait a minute!

636
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,288
What? What now?

637
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,705
Belgium and Tunisia are playing.
I need to get home--

638
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:22,211
We don't have time for that!

639
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:25,291
Pha Mee is getting
30 millimeters of rain per hour.

640
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:28,825
And rain clouds in Khun Nam
are rolling in at an alarming rate.

641
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:31,173
[Odd] Okay.

642
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,580
[Noon] Pha Mee, Khun Nam, and Chiang Rai.

643
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:41,001
We can't afford to wait around here.

644
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:47,996
Okay.

645
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,080
Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai,
and Mae Hong Son, but that's it.

646
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:57,416
It's up to the senior provincial officers
to decide whether or not

647
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,920
they want to issue an alert.

648
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:01,291
Okay?

649
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:04,996
And just remember,

650
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,000
put <i>your</i> signature down
to verify the paperwork.

651
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,830
If anything goes south,

652
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:12,958
you'll be responsible.

653
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:14,496
Understand?

654
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,790
Interns must be pretty easy to blame,
aren't we?

00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:26,495
-[Dom] It's beautiful.
-[Note] Awesome.

671
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:28,673
What's that?
I've never seen anything like it.

672
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,960
[boy 1] Wow.

673
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,711
-[boy 2] Look at that.
-[boy 3] So cool.

674
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:35,206
-[Mark] Look over there!
-[Biw] It's so pretty.

675
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:37,921
-[Dom] It looks just like a starry sky.
-[Phong] Wow!

676
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,920
-That's gorgeous
-You're right.

677
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,250
Maybe. But it's not as nice
as the real sky.

678
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,333
[Note] Wow.

679
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:45,126
Hey! Joking.

680
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:46,918
[all laughing]

681
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
-[alarm beeping]
-[boys laughing]

682
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,173
Coach, it's four o'clock.

683
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:55,078
Hey, Coach.
Can we stay for five more minutes?

684
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,286
Solid try.

685
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:59,423
Come on, then. Tee, time to go back.

686
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,830
Let's come back again.

687
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:02,706
[Eak] Next time for sure.

688
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,080
-[Mix] I wanna be in the middle.
-[Dom] I'll guard the back.

689
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:08,286
-[Titan] What a show-off.
-[Eak] Anyone else over there?

690
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:09,955
[Adul] May God show us the way.

691
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,330
No.

692
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,133
[Tee] Coach Eak!

693
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:14,748
I think we have a problem!

694
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:15,793
[Dom] What's wrong?

695
00:39:16,416 --> 00:39:17,456
[Titan] What is it?

696
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:20,538
[Eak] Walk carefully.

697
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:23,293
[Titan] What is it?

698
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:25,461
[foreboding music playing]

699
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:31,575
[dialing]

700
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,038
[thunder rumbling]

701
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,833
[cell phone ringing]

702
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,960
Hello? What is it?

703
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,128
No, I haven't seen Phong.

704
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:50,375
Biw was gonna pick him up
this morning from what I know.

705
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,170
Well,

706
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,208
I'll give you a call back when I can.

707
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,958
[foreboding music playing]

708
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:12,960
THAM LUANG ENTRANCE

709
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:16,041
[Night's mom] I'm really sorry
to keep you waiting.

710
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:18,285
Usually, Night doesn't stay out this late.

711
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:22,165
[man] I'm sure he's fine.
Don't worry. He'll be here.

712
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:25,458
-[Nop] Boon-Nam. Where is everyone?
-[Boon-Nam] Hi.

713
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:27,461
[Night's mom] Come in quick.
You're soaked.

714
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,543
You didn't go with the others
after the game?

715
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:33,995
No, I didn't.
My mom was baking cookies today.

716
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,293
So I didn't wanna go to Tham Luang Cave.

717
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,375
[Night's mom] Huh?

718
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,250
Boon-Nam. Boon-Nam. Boon-Nam.

719
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:43,076
Who went to Tham Luang?

720
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:45,666
Eak did. With the whole team.

721
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:49,955
Yeah, Coach. They all went there together
after the game. Why?

722
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:54,166
[Nop] When was the last time
you saw or heard from Night?

723
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:57,130
-[Night's dad] At the game this morning.
-[Night's mom] Yeah, the game.

724
00:40:58,458 --> 00:40:59,708
Call him right now, okay?

725
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,461
-[Night's dad] Call Night.
-Do it right now!

726
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:04,171
Boon-Nam, try to call all the boys.

727
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:06,630
Tell me if you reach anyone.
I'm calling Eak.

728
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:49,706
[yelling] Eak! Eak! Can you hear me?

729
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:51,831
Who's there?

730
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:57,035
The cave is flooded!

731
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:59,035
There's no way in! And no way out!

732
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:09,536
Dear!

733
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:13,286
[Night's dad]
<i>Is one of these Night's bike?</i>

734
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:20,035
Hello.

735
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:23,246
[gasps]

736
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:26,288
Oh!

737
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,833
[groans]

738
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:31,625
[dull thud]

739
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,128
[cell phone ringing]

740
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:38,961
-Hello.
-[man] <i>Hello, Governor.</i>

741
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:42,131
<i>We're calling to report there may be</i>
<i>several kids trapped in Tham Luang Cave.</i>

742
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:43,288
How many?

743
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:47,168
[Pim] This is the only entry point.

744
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,250
[Nop] Are you sure?

745
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,580
[distant voices shouting]

746
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:53,036
[Titan's mom] Titan!

747
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:56,713
[woman] Hurry up!

748
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,285
[Night's mom] Night, where are you?

749
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,173
[man] Son! Where are you?

750
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:05,578
Nop! Where is he? Let me see my son now!

751
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:09,286
[Nop] No, no, no, no, no. Hold on!
You can't go in there. It's dangerous.

752
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:11,498
I already tried!

753
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,540
And so did the rangers.

754
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:14,625
[women crying]

755
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:16,078
The current pushed us out.

756
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:18,285
There's no way through.

757
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,673
-[Titan's dad] Where is Eak?
-[Nop] In there with the others.

758
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,460
Please calm down.
We've called the local authorities.

759
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:27,421
Why didn't you close the cave, huh?
This is your fault!

760
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:34,081
[sobbing] Night's birthday party
was tonight.

761
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:38,003
There's no way they might drown, right?

762
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:41,875
How can they survive in there?

763
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:46,628
[crying] How do we get them home?

764
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:52,833
[climactic music plays]

765
00:43:57,541 --> 00:44:00,251
