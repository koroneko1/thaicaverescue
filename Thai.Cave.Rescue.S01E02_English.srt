171
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,750
-But there'll be a lot of police there.
-[Namhom] Give me the keys now!

172
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:39,713
Thanks.

173
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,706
Excuse me, sir. Officer!

174
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,421
Sir, excuse me.

175
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,000
Please, I'd like to talk to someone
about my son.

176
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,923
I believe he's inside that cave.

177
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
-All right. What's his name?
-Mongkol Bunpiam. "Mark."

178
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,126
No. He's not on the list.
Have you been contacted about it?

179
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,498
-I haven't. But when I heard--
-He's probably with a girl somewhere.

180
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,423
Officer, please!

181
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,880
-[officer] Do not pass the gate!
-Wait. Listen to me. Please!

182
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,378
Just tell us what's going on! Please!

183
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,830
[man] I don't understand what's taking
so long with these rangers, Nop.

184
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,536
Relax. Look. They're waiting for him.

185
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,580
He's like an amateur mapmaker.
Out here all the time.

186
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,536
Most importantly,
no one knows Tham Luang better than him.

187
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,378
Wait here. I'm sure he'll know what to do.

188
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,708
What do I do, then?

189
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,291
They think I'll stay here
while my son dies in that cave?

190
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:44,415
Right now, we can only pray
that the spirits stop the rain,

191
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,290
making the water level drop.

192
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,785
You sound like my wife.

193
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:51,075
Look, Coach, superstition doesn't save
drowning boys, all right!

194
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,915
[Narongsak] The rangers tell me
you are a hobbyist.

195
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,130
You've been exploring the cave
during the dry season for years.

196
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,500
Please, tell me.
What do you know about Tham Luang?

197
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,250
She's…

198
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,708
Well, Governor, Tham Luang is a monster.

199
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:17,036
The cave runs into the mountain due west
towards Myanmar several miles.

200
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,785
There's multiple chambers,
caverns all different sizes

201
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,495
that open and then close down again
to narrow tunnels,

202
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,883
just wide enough
to get your shoulders through.

203
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,828
We've assembled a group
of local rescue workers to go in.

204
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,416
[man] I wanna volunteer.

205
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
-Is your son in there?
-Yes, he is.

206
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,963
Ekkarat Wongsukchan. We call him "Biw."

207
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,751
Can you swim, mister?

208
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,543
Now, we start in chamber 1.

209
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:55,325
<i>If the sump connecting chambers 1 and 2</i>
<i>hasn't completely flooded yet,</i>

210
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,376
<i>it </i>will<i> soon.</i>

211
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,705
<i>Once these narrow passages</i>
<i>are filled with water,</i>

212
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,501
<i>our only option will be to swim.</i>

213
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,998
<i>If the boys are alive, then they'll be</i>
<i>in a dry chamber surrounded by water.</i>

214
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,998
<i>Water is our enemy here.</i>
<i>It's the evil in the monster.</i>

215
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,826
[wind whistling]

216
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,463
[loud rumbling]

217
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,211
-Is that a quake?
-[Tle] I felt it too.

218
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,381
[Phong] What was it?

219
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,788
-[Tle] What's going on?
-[Phong] You hear that?

220
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,875
[rumbling getting louder]

221
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,583
[rumbling getting even louder]

222
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,580
[Tle] Water! Coach!

223
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,876
[foreboding music playing]

224
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,958
Tee, flash flood! Lead them out!

225
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:54,291
Hurry! We gotta go!
The tunnel to Pattaya will flood!

226
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,455
[Eak shouting]

227
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,791
[boys screaming]

228
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,625
[Eak] Hold on. The flashlight!

229
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,918
[boys yelling]

230
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,381
[Eak] Let's go!

231
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,825
[boys shouting]

232
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,083
[Eak] Keep moving!

233
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,285
[Mix screams]

234
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:30,828
[Eak] Help your team!

235
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,666
-[Adul] Come on, Dom!
-[Dom] I'm not gonna make it.

236
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,500
[Adul] Come on! Let's go.

237
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,630
[Eak] Move! Keep moving!

238
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,630
[Mix] Go! Go! Move it! Hurry up!

239
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,538
I'm scared! I'm not gonna make it!

240
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,785
[Adul] Faster! Faster!

241
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,995
[Eak] Pattaya's just beyond
this sump, Biw!

242
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,963
Breathe. Please believe
this is gonna work out, all right?

243
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:54,501
Right now, go.
I'll be with Mark, okay? Biw!

244
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,963
You have to hold onto Dom.

245
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,671
Mark, take a deep breath.

246
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,580
[Narongsak] <i>You think they drowned?</i>

247
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:16,916
I think so.

248
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,633
I don't know about your boys,

249
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,495
but my boy, Biw,

250
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,253
he can't swim.

251
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,833
Until they rescue those boys,
I'm going to make offerings.

252
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,293
[Biw's dad] It's not possible!
Don't you get it?

253
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,128
Come on.

254
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,955
Come up and pray.

255
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,921
If we have any chance
of getting our sons back,

256
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,210
we need to pray
to every single one of the spirits

257
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,041
and beg them to help our children.

258
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,541
-[Titan's mom crying]
-[Titan's dad] They're going to find them.

259
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,915
Let's pray. Come on.
The governor will be able to help us.

260
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,751
This is a test. We've done something
to offend the spirits.

261
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,380
Your poor boy.

262
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,041
Adul, as I recall, is his name.

263
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,165
Are you Christian?

264
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,420
[Adul's dad] We do not believe
that we can buy God's mercy,

265
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,710
but I know our congregation
is reciting prayers for him.

266
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,503
As well as for all the others.

267
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:37,631
Every day.

268
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:53,541
Chamber 3 was as far as we made it
before the water forced us back out.

269
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,791
This is chambers 4, 5, and 6.

270
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:01,205
1.6 miles at least,
buried under 600 meters of limestone.

271
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,536
Then you hit Sam Yak.
That's the T-junction.

272
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,205
That's where the path splits.
They could’ve gone either way.

273
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,881
If they hung a right at the Monk’s Series,
that’s where the water’s flooding from.

274
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,628
If they went that way, then they

275
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,708
almost certainly drowned.

276
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,961
If they went the other way,
left at the T-junction?

277
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,831
To Pattaya?
Oh, they'd have a better chance.

278
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:33,003
You’re telling me there’s a huge beach
inside these mountains?

279
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,173
Not exactly paradise but it’s elevated.

280
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,960
It's a big sandy hill that--
Dropping down into a pool of water.

281
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,583
And we can't reach there
without scuba gear?

282
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:48,246
We're gonna need more than air tanks
and a diving certificate.

283
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:52,753
The current in these sumps is fast.
It's filled with silt. You can barely see.

284
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:56,133
We're gonna need extremely fit divers.

285
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:57,996
Then, who?

286
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,713
Navy SEALs?

287
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:01,955
Sure.

288
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,171
[chuckles] Sure! That'd be great.

289
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,423
[Kiattisak] <i>It's probably nothing.</i>

290
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,330
Just kids being kids, off on an adventure.

291
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,290
Let the local authorities handle this.

292
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,380
You don't want to risk losing face
over some merest problems.

293
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,668
You're above this.

294
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:28,245
Please, sir. The people here
aren't as experienced as I am.

295
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,210
<i>They've already said</i>
<i>they're going to transfer me,</i>

296
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,881
<i>what else could they do to me?</i>

297
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,208
Are you sure you really want to do this?

298
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:39,381
<i>You're asking me to call for</i>
<i>the most elite special forces we have,</i>

299
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,668
<i>who are a little more than focused</i>
<i>on their annual exams right now.</i>

300
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,580
Yeah.

301
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,463
Those servicemen<i>,</i>

302
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,461
<i>they are not your friends.</i>

303
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,631
<i>At the end of the day,</i>
<i>they will not lose face for you.</i>

304
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,038
<i>Or anybody else.</i>

305
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,330
<i>Imagine, if they help you</i>

306
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,076
and the situation
starts to go bad out there.

307
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,330
Think about their reputation.

308
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,286
And your reputation.

309
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,750
Remember…

310
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,248
when you first sent me here,

311
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,290
you said to me,
"It's hard for people in the capital

312
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,875
to understand what's happening
out in the country."

313
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,881
You told me to put my faith
in the men on the ground.

314
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,171
Remember that?

315
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,580
Okay.

316
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,206
I will allow it.

317
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,458
<i>But you'd better hope</i>
<i>those boys are still alive.</i>

318
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,035
[phone clicks]

319
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,001
[Eak and Mark gasping desperately]

320
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,751
[Note shouting] Damn it!
How is anyone ever gonna find us here?

321
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,253
[Mix] I'm too young to die!

322
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,003
-[Mark gasping]
-Okay. Okay now.

323
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,293
[Mark gasping]

324
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,955
[Titan] I'm only 11!
I got a long life to live!

325
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,921
-[Eak] It's okay. It's all right, Mark.
-[Mark crying]

326
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,750
[Night] It's my birthday. I don't care
that my mom bought a SpongeBob cake!

327
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,003
I just don't want her
to eat it without me!

328
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,383
[boys crying]

329
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:13,418
[Nick] Are your parents
gonna eat it without you? [sobbing]

330
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,040
[all crying and groaning]

331
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,253
[Biw] Hey. Come on. Hey.

332
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,963
[Phong] Get off! Leave me alone, Biw!

333
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,583
-[Biw softly] Hey.
-[Eak] Let me.

334
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:32,881
-Phong. Phong. Phong!
-[Phong] Go away!

335
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,495
Settle down. That's enough!

336
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,753
We're all standing here in our graves!

337
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,753
No one will ever find us!

338
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,293
[solemn silence]

339
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,793
Nobody is dying here, Phong!

340
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,248
No one will die in here!

341
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,325
[crossly] Now, everyone, sit down!

342
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,791
And you too, Phong!

343
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:06,498
We can get scared.
That's fine. But don't panic.

344
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,250
[Phong sobbing]

345
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,333
I'm gonna get you home, okay?

346
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:20,883
[wails]

347
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,075
[man echoing] Eak.

348
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:35,035
At the monastery, when I was growing up,

349
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,206
whenever I was upset,

350
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,421
the monks would make me
meditate with them.

351
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,498
I didn't wanna do it.

352
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:44,633
But you know what?

353
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,290
They were right.

354
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,745
If we meditate,

355
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,456
we'll have something to focus on.

356
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,083
It'll stop you
from freaking out like this.

357
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,325
When our minds are calm,

358
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,746
we can overcome fear.

359
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,125
[Adul sobbing]

360
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,581
[gently] Adul. Adul?

361
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,580
Let's meditate.

362
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:25,456
You don't need to be
a Buddhist to meditate.

363
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:28,668
Do you wanna try?

364
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,460
[Adul breathing rapidly]

365
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:31,711
Let's try, okay?

366
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:37,253
[softly] Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

367
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,333
Good. Take a deep breath.

368
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,833
[Adul breathes more slowly]

369
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:43,673
[Eak] Good.

370
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,498
Everyone, let's try it.

371
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:48,633
Let's try, Tee.

372
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:56,538
Mark, let's try.

373
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,171
Now focus on the tip of your nose.

374
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:06,381
Okay, and inhale Lord.

375
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,501
Exhale Buddha.

376
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:13,746
And inhale Lord.

377
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,503
[boys sobbing]

378
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:16,793
[Eak] Exhale Buddha.

379
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:21,831
[chanting] <i>Sabbe Satta!</i>

380
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:26,416
Whatever living beings there may be,

381
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,630
whether they are weak or strong,

382
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,786
omitting none, the great or the mighty,

383
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,788
the seen and the unseen,

384
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:40,171
may all beings be at ease.

385
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,083
[silence]

386
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:59,995
[Namhom] I've looked everywhere.
He wouldn't run away. He's not a bad boy.

387
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,083
[officer 1] Could be more mischievous
than you think.

388
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:04,536
Please. His coach would know him. Please.

389
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,955
[officer 2] Hey! He already told you,
you don't belong here.

390
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:09,961
It's better that your son's not here.

391
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,461
We'd better be prepared.

392
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:14,381
Now the story's on the news,
we're gonna see many more like her.

393
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:17,668
You're not from around here.
Your accent sounds foreign.

394
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,290
Please. I wouldn't lie to you, sir.

395
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:23,575
He went missing.
He was-- He was with the Wild Boars--

396
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,456
[officer 2] You can get in trouble
for falsely reporting a missing child.

397
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,631
-Show me your papers.
-[Namhom] But…

398
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:35,078
-Coach Nop! Coach Nop!
-[officer 2] Hey! Stop!

399
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:37,286
-[Namhom] Coach Nop!
-[officer 2] You need to calm down!

400
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:39,575
Stop it! I could have you
deported, you know?

401
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,673
Governor.

402
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:44,245
What's going on?

403
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:47,463
[officer 1] Sir, this woman
says her son’s in the cave.

404
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:50,171
But all the children
and guardians are accounted for.

405
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:54,633
Please, sir. Please believe me.
I know my son's in there.

406
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:58,791
Coach, my son. I beg you.

407
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:01,625
You know my son Mark, Mongkol Bunpiam.

408
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:03,128
Okay, yeah. I know him.

409
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,628
But I didn't see Mark
at the field yesterday.

410
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,495
Mark hasn't come to practice for a while.

411
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:11,833
[voice cracking] No.

412
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:16,673
I've come up

413
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,165
with no Thai papers.

414
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,791
With no documents at all.

415
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:25,628
I am Tai Yai. I am from Kengtung.

416
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:30,458
Why should I risk everything to come
if I didn't believe my son's in that cave?

417
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:33,461
Unless I thought
he was really here. [sobbing]

418
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:41,786
Okay, she stays. Until we're certain
how many kids are stuck inside.

419
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:44,996
[Nop] Namhom. Namhom! Namhom!

420
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:55,458
-Phong. Phong.
-[Phong groaning] What?

421
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,038
What is it?

422
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,995
What is it? Why-- Why you waking me up?

423
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,380
[Eak] Come here.

424
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:05,631
[Phong] What's going on? What?

425
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:07,253
What's with you?

426
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:13,036
Tee. If we go far enough,
we can connect to Myanmar and leave here.

427
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:16,753
You'll be in charge while I'm gone, okay?

428
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:21,165
-Make sure they don't pull any pranks.
-Okay. [moans]

429
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,418
[Phong] What's going on?

430
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,130
Phong, follow me.

431
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,038
[high-pitched squeaking]

432
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:36,578
[Phong] What's that sound?
Are there animals in here?

433
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:38,996
[squeaking continues]

434
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,578
[Eak] Wow.

435
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:51,753
[Biw moaning]

436
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,213
Mom.

437
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:56,325
[groaning] We're out of Lactasoy.

438
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:57,626
[Eak chuckles]

439
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:02,293
Let's go. We need to explore.

440
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,330
[Phong] You think there's really
a way out?

441
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,995
[Eak] The path to the right is steep.

442
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,125
But it's safer from the water.

443
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:13,921
There is a way out of here.

444
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,580
Phong.

445
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,580
Slow down, Phong.

446
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:33,165
You doing okay?

447
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:35,423
Phong?

448
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,630
[loud crunch]

449
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,330
[groans]

450
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:52,746
[groans]

451
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:55,995
[Phong] Eak!

452
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:58,205
Phong.

453
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,330
Phong!

454
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,670
[Phong weeping]

455
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,745
[Phong sobbing desperately]

456
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:16,285
[Phong] You were wrong!
There's no way out!

457
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:19,915
[shouting] How can you be so calm?

458
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,420
You know we're stuck in here now!

459
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,460
I know there are people out there
looking for us right now.

460
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,793
[sobbing] Nobody is looking for me.

461
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:32,955
[Phong sobbing]

462
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,205
Phong.

463
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,331
I only have my grandmother.

464
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,000
Before I left yesterday,

465
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:45,415
I fought with her really badly.

466
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:48,918
She's trying to send me
to my uncle's in Chiang Mai.

467
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
[sobbing] I was so mad at her,
I didn't tell her where I was going.

468
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:57,133
I even thought, "Maybe I won't come home."

469
00:30:57,625 --> 00:31:01,745
"So she can see… how much she needs me."

470
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:05,666
[voice breaking] I didn't--
I didn't mean for this to happen.

471
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:09,581
I don't want this! [sobbing]

472
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,173
Phong, listen to me.

473
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,376
I'll tell you something.

474
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,126
All I had was my dad.

475
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:23,291
[muffled Buddhist chanting]

476
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,915
[distant gong rings out]

477
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,075
But then he died.

478
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,170
<i>My uncle said he was taking me</i>
<i>to the monastery for…</i>

479
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,630
better education.

480
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:47,381
It was so I could have
a better life, you know?

481
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:56,421
But it didn't feel that way at first.

482
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,461
Being sent away is never easy.

483
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:04,581
It really hurts.

484
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,630
But you are gonna keep going.

485
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:11,878
[Phong sniffs]

486
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:15,248
And you <i>will</i> survive this.

487
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:22,541
[breathes shakily]

488
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:24,788
Better?

489
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,963
Yeah. [chuckles]

490
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:30,881
What?

491
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:34,495
Biw sucked a dude's toe.

492
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:36,878
Thought it was Lactasoy. [laughs]

493
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:39,958
-Never gonna let him forget that.
-[Phong] Never.

494
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,461
That's crazy.

495
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:51,788
Now what do we do?

496
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,325
[Eak] Be careful. It's slippery.

497
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:00,705
[Phong] Huh?

498
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,333
-Eak! Wait!
-[Eak] Hmm?

499
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,246
[Phong] Look.

500
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:09,461
Over here. We missed it on the way in.

501
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:12,628
Looks like some kind of writing
on the wall.

502
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,288
You see what I see?

503
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:18,668
[shouts] Yeah!

504
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,166
[dramatic music playing]

505
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:35,626
[man 1] Guys, the military's here!

506
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:40,036
-They're here to help us!
-[man 2] It'll be okay. That's them.

507
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:53,791
What do my men need to know
before they go into the cave?

508
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,665
Before we strap on scuba gear

509
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,420
and things escalate,
we need to take a wider view.

510
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:02,208
The boys' lives are at risk.

511
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,961
But there are about to be others.

512
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:05,881
Yours.

513
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:09,785
-You brought a doctor with you?
-Dr. Bhak is a SEAL.

514
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:14,075
A combat medic and certified expert
in extreme health crises.

515
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:17,825
The boys have been inside
since Saturday afternoon.

516
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:21,463
We have no idea how much food or water,

517
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:23,251
if any, they have with them.

518
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:26,753
Given the obvious circumstance,
I’d say it’s generally good news.

519
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:29,253
We know they're young.
They're soccer players.

520
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,083
So we know that they are fit.

521
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:34,043
As long as they’re not injured
or infected with something,

522
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:35,245
they should be in good shape.

523
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:38,753
A few days without food
is unpleasant but not deadly.

524
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,126
[clears throat] Okay. Well, uh,

525
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:49,538
as far as I know,
there’s only one way in and one way out.

526
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:51,421
[Titan] This way out?

527
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:53,328
No way.

528
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:56,416
[Eak] Imagine a mountain, like a pyramid.

529
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,920
Wide bottom, narrow top.
Phong and I already checked it out.

530
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:02,165
If we dig up that way,

531
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,290
we'll reach the top
in about five to ten meters.

532
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:06,625
No way.

533
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:08,168
[Eak] Well, see for yourself.

534
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:12,205
Look at all this rough rock.
You can see that it caved in.

535
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:15,961
If we all dig together, we'll probably
climb out into the middle of a field.

536
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:23,708
Come on, guys. Who's gonna help us dig?

537
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,130
I can help out with the digging.

538
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:32,628
All right. Mark's gonna help.

539
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:34,208
Anybody else?

540
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:35,581
[silence]

541
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:48,961
[Eak] I know you're hungry.
I won't tell you to not think about food.

542
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,540
I can tell you that it's easier
to go without food than you might think.

543
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:58,213
-I only ate one meal a day for ten years.
-[Titan] Yeah, you were a monk then.

544
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:01,206
[Eak] You think monks never get hungry?

545
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:05,001
At first, the hunger was so bad
I didn't think I'd ever survive.

546
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:08,133
But one day,
a monk told me to drink water.

547
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,748
So I drank. And I drank a lot of water.

548
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:14,326
There. We can drink from here
because it's filtered

549
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:15,746
through the stones,

550
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,785
Try to imagine you're eating KFC.

551
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,875
[chuckles] So, who wants to go first?

552
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:23,381
No one?

553
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:28,211
Hey. You go first, Titan.
You're small but you got a big mouth.

554
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:29,211
[Titan] Hmm.

555
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:31,171
-Go on.
-[Eak] It's decided.

556
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,580
[Titan] Um, I don't know.

557
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:35,455
[Tee] Really?

558
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:36,501
[all] Drink it!

559
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:37,423
[Titan sighs]

560
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,786
-[Titan groans]
-[Eak] How is it?

561
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,918
It tastes like my grandma's cooking.

562
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,460
[all laughing]

563
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:48,711
-[Night] I'll try it now.
-[Note] I'm next!

564
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:49,961
[boys calling out]

565
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:50,881
[Eak] Try it.

566
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,918
-[Phong] Drink it.
-[Mark] Does it taste good?

567
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,750
[Night] Yeah, it does. Tastes great.

568
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,793
-[Phong] It really does!
-[Night] Tastes weird.

569
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:58,205
-[Eak] Tee.
-[Phong] I want more.

570
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:00,171
[boys continue chattering]

571
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,710
Organize everyone into groups,
just like on the soccer field.

572
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,421
We'll each take turns.

573
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:09,043
And start saving flashlights
for digging only.

574
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:12,205
Do you really think <i>that's</i> the way out?

575
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:14,831
I don't wanna take a chance if it's not.

576
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:17,286
I think it's worth a try. Don't you?

577
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,543
[phone rings]

578
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:29,495
TMD. Noon. Can I help you?

579
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:30,793
<i>Hello, it's Pim.</i>

580
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,285
We spoke yesterday.
-<i>Hi, Pim.</i>

581
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,075
<i>I saw the local news report online.</i>

582
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:36,626
Have you been able to find
the soccer players yet?

583
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:39,748
Not yet. But the rescue team
is actively working on it.

584
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:42,833
The governor would like weather reports
every hour. Is that possible?

585
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:45,746
Yeah, sure.
If you need anything else, just call.

586
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:46,923
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

587
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,630
-[Noon] Odd, sir.
-[Odd] Hmm?

588
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:53,208
The governor in Chiang Rai
wants reports hourly.

589
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,131
[Odd] Hmm.

590
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:57,713
Yeah. Call everyone back here,
and set up a meeting.

591
00:37:58,458 --> 00:37:59,498
Wish you luck.

592
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:04,326
Um, I'm taking this as an actual command.

593
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,246
[Odd] Mm-hmm.

594
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:11,668
Everyone ready?

595
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,665
[Vern] <i>Chamber 3 is fail-safe.</i>

596
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:19,673
The boys have to be beyond chamber 3.

597
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,750
[Bhak] Hello everyone. Make way, please.

598
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,543
[parents talking excitedly]

599
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:25,496
Our son will be fine.

600
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:37,245
[Vern] <i>You have to imagine that every</i>
<i>raindrop that falls is an added risk.</i>

601
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,793
<i>The more it rains, the worse it gets.</i>

602
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:42,075
<i>And it's all flowing into </i>that<i> cave.</i>

603
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:50,288
<i>If the current's strong enough</i>
<i>coming off the T-junction,</i>

604
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:51,705
<i>it’ll be kicking like a mule.</i>

605
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:54,251
So you’ll need all your strength
for the next sump.

606
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,630
Go.

607
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,825
[Vern] <i>Not only is it narrow,</i>
<i>but the turns are sharper.</i>

608
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:16,293
<i>There are more alleys.</i>
<i>Most of all, stay in your lane.</i>

609
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:18,415
<i>Don't wander into the alleys</i>
<i>or you’ll get lost</i>

610
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,710
<i>and deplete your oxygen.</i>

611
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:21,878
<i>Watch your reserves.</i>

612
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,380
<i>Every millimeter forward will be a fight.</i>

613
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:26,498
[diver gasps]

614
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:29,575
[Vern] <i>It's an underwater battle.</i>

615
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:31,828
Good luck.

616
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:44,325
[Phong] Can you move it?

617
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:46,878
[groans]

618
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:48,625
[Eak] Not on my own.

619
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:50,248
Let's try again. Now.

620
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,883
[Phong] Come on, guys.

621
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,750
[Appakorn] The situation
is more complicated

622
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:15,543
than we initially thought it was.

623
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:17,995
But we'll try again tomorrow.

624
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,960
[all grunting]

625
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:35,786
[all grunting, groaning]

626
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,380
-[Phong] Oh my God!
-[boys grunt in frustration]

627
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:43,288
-[Night] That was tiring.
-[Mark] Damn it!

628
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,205
[Eak sighs]

629
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:19,751
[gasps]

630
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:30,333
[dull thud]

631
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,671
[diver breathing erratically]

632
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:50,456
-[man 1] They're coming.
-[man 2] This way.

633
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:55,883
[people talking expectantly]

634
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,125
[solemn silence]

635
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:03,538
[somber music playing]

636
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:36,285
[people muttering worriedly]

637
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:42,631
[Narongsak] <i>The boys</i>
<i>have been inside for four days,</i>

638
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:44,578
and we haven't made any progress.

639
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:46,286
They don't have many more days.

640
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:49,535
I will <i>not</i> be reckless with my men.

641
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,790
We will move as fast as it is safe to.

642
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:54,705
I'm not asking for recklessness.

643
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:56,921
Nor am I questioning your system.

644
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,580
Systems save lives.

645
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:02,075
But we need to change tactics.

646
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:04,706
We haven't even made it to chamber 4.

647
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,461
I’m open to ideas.

648
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:10,503
I think we need specialists.

649
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:13,208
<i>You</i> are the specialists.

650
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:16,581
There’s no one better
at underwater diving than Navy SEALs.

651
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:18,996
I’m a doctor, but I’m not a surgeon.

652
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,423
Can I perform surgery if I have to?

653
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,960
Sure. But you wouldn't want me to
because that's not my specialty.

654
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:27,128
I put myself on the line

655
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:31,248
with the ministers in Bangkok
to get you all here.

656
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,213
[yells] Now you're saying
you cannot do it!

657
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:34,131
[Chet] Governor,

658
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:35,751
we’re SEALs.

659
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:38,253
We’re trained for combat diving.

660
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:42,003
Beachheads, limpet mines,
fast attack boats.

661
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:44,293
But here, we have to learn as we go.

662
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:45,915
We've never done this before.

663
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:47,746
Okay.

664
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:50,921
Then who has?

665
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:54,291
[Vern] Governor. I have an idea.

666
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:58,418
First, you wanted Navy SEALs.

667
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:02,996
[angrily] And now, I just heard
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

668
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:06,333
<i>that you have divers from half a dozen</i>
<i>other countries coming in?</i>

669
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:09,128
[shouting] Have you lost your mind?

670
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:10,708
It's been four days.

671
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:14,708
The doctor's saying
that they're beginning to starve.

672
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:17,881
Would you rather
let the boys die in the cave, huh?

673
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,960
I'd rather you consider
they may not be alive in there

674
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,581
<i>before you make foreigners</i>
<i>aware of our predicament.</i>

675
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,830
<i>There's no coming back from this now.</i>

676
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:44,381
<i>People might think</i>
<i>you're doing this to save face.</i>

677
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:47,671
<i>But you can't save face</i>

678
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:52,633
<i>for an entire government,</i>
<i>the whole of Thailand.</i>

679
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:55,378
[unheard dialogue]

680
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:58,748
[Kiattisak] <i>If it doesn't work out,</i>
<i>no one will touch you.</i>

681
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:01,173
<i>You'll be lucky to just never work again.</i>

682
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,378
No second chances here.

683
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:05,960
Don't fail.

684
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,418
-[phone clicks loudly]
-[inhales deeply]

685
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:20,495
[Mix] At least no one will die of boredom
from my dad telling that story

686
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:23,173
about how his friend
got trapped in a cave ever again.

687
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,920
Now he can talk about
how his son got trapped with his team.

688
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,420
-[Note chuckles]
-Wanna hamburger?

689
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,080
-[Tle] Yeah. I do.
-Here.

690
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:32,543
-Hey, I want pork.
-[Mix] Just a minute.

691
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:34,211
-[Tle] Mix.
-Huh?

692
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:35,961
-You forgot the sauce.
-Oh really?

693
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:38,211
-Where's your appetite, man?
-[Tle chuckles]

694
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:39,501
-[Tle] You.
-Don't be picky.

695
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:41,293
[Tee] Shift change! Note, you're up.

696
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:42,455
-[Note sighs]
-[Tee] Go.

697
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:45,501
-I'm waiting for my pork.
-[Tee] You'll have to take it home.

698
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:47,463
-Go.
-[Note] You're such a spoilsport.

699
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,578
-Is my grilled pork ready?
-Sure.

700
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:51,376
-[Note] Thank you.
-[Tee] Let's go.

701
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,705
[Note] You're always
interrupting my meal, Tee.

702
00:45:56,416 --> 00:45:57,626
Tle. Tle.

703
00:45:57,708 --> 00:45:58,538
[Tle] Huh?

704
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:02,251
Hey, it's your turn. How long
do you think before he realizes it?

705
00:46:03,791 --> 00:46:06,671
Oh, man, I don't know.
He'll be pretty pissed off.

706
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,460
-At you!
-[laughs] Oh yeah.

707
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:18,625
If anyone can get those boys out,
it's these guys.

708
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:22,418
They've come from, uh, Finland,
Canada, Ukraine by way of Cyprus,

709
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,750
oh, and my first love, the United Kingdom.

710
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:28,043
Rick Stanton and John Volanthen,
leaders of the pack.

711
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:30,541
Thank you for coming all this way.

712
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,210
And so quickly.

713
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:36,171
The SEALs can help you
with the scuba gear and anything you need.

714
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:41,036
Oh, uh, we appreciate that,
but, uh, we only dive with our own gear.

715
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:43,535
You think your gear is better
than my SEALs gear?

716
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:45,995
We find the gear
that open water divers use

717
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:47,713
doesn't work for caves.

718
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:50,791
We tuck our air tanks here, under the arm,

719
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:53,325
on the side,
so we're not bumping the ceiling.

720
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:54,916
Uh, water-light helmets,

721
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,750
floats, doesn't sink,
and protects your head from stalactites.

722
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,543
The mask is secured underneath.

723
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:01,915
What is <i>that</i>?

724
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,880
-Oh, that's, uh, that's my wing.
-Your what?

725
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:07,378
It's a buoyancy device I fashioned myself,

726
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:10,418
uh, out of an inner tube
of a motorbike tire.

727
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:11,876
Works a treat.

728
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,455
-Doesn't it, John?
-It's an inflatable ballast.

729
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:20,041
Keeps you level in the water.

730
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:22,745
So you're not constantly bumping
into the stalagmites on the floor,

731
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:25,883
which are very sharp
and will cut you and your suit up.

732
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:30,376
All these will enable you
to make forward progress?

733
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:32,538
[John] Only way that's possible
in the silt water…

734
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:35,535
Only way you have a chance
in the current is to lay the guideline.

735
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:38,375
From the first chamber
to as far as it takes to find them.

736
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:40,458
Now, the guideline is like

737
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:45,166
Ariadne's thread to Theseus
in the labyrinth of the Minotaur.

738
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:47,171
[Vern snickers]

739
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:50,455
Without it, we're all blind.

740
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:53,041
We lose time and oxygen
searching out the blind alleys.

741
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:55,205
And we have to
relearn the route every time.

742
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:57,331
So, instead, we secure it,

743
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,376
tying glow sticks on for visibility.

744
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:02,248
And the next man comes along, adds to it.

745
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:04,423
What else? What else do you need from us?

746
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,420
Rope. And lots of it.

747
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,420
I'll find you the rope.
Get prepared to dive.

748
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,460
[dramatic music playing]

749
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:19,376
[Appakorn] <i>We must move</i>
<i>safely but urgently.</i>

750
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:21,878
<i>The foreign divers</i>
<i>will lay down the guideline</i>

751
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:24,825
<i>while we pre-position supplies</i>
<i>in each chamber.</i>

752
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,580
In the event you find the boys,
I'm issuing you all extra gel packs.

753
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:38,578
Why bother with this, huh?

754
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,503
The kids are probably already dead.

755
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:44,788
[Night's dad shouting]
Night! Please! Come home!

756
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:49,245
[Tle's dad shouting] Tle! It's me! Dad!

757
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:51,583
We may not be there to help find them,

758
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:54,503
but we can have faith.

759
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:56,043
It's the best we can do right now.

760
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:07,035
The boys' bodies are now entering ketosis,

761
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:09,245
<i>the state of burning all their fat stores.</i>

762
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:17,211
<i>Their bodies are now starting</i>
<i>to eat their own muscles to stay alive.</i>

763
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:21,581
<i>Whatever strength they have,</i>
<i>they'll be fighting to keep.</i>

764
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,576
[Night's dad shouting]
<i>Please come back home!</i>

765
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:32,826
Night!

766
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:35,578
<i>Please! Let's go home together!</i>

767
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,790
[Bhak] <i>If they have</i>
<i>a clean source of water at all,</i>

768
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:46,875
<i>they might have a day or two left.</i>

769
00:49:50,916 --> 00:49:53,916
And as the neuro and limbic systems
start to malfunction,

770
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:56,291
they will have hallucinations.

771
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:58,375
[female voice echoing] Biw. Biw.

772
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:00,421
[Biw] Princess?

773
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:13,628
[Tle's dad shouting] Tle! My son!

774
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:15,788
[Night's dad shouting]
Daddy's waiting for you!

775
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:25,995
[Bhak] <i>The real danger now is that</i>
<i>they're in a chamber that's too small.</i>

776
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
<i>They've depleted</i>
<i>their oxygen levels to toxic.</i>

777
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:33,673
<i>Dioxide buildup in the lungs</i>
<i>will eventually cause hypoxia,</i>

778
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,830
<i>which means their hearts could stop.</i>

779
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:47,881
<i>Eight days.</i>

780
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:51,673
They'll start to have
motor muscle trouble now

781
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,500
<i>if</i> they can still move at all.

782
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:57,078
And, in addition to hallucinations,

783
00:50:58,208 --> 00:51:00,788
their internal organs
are starting to lose function.

784
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,040
The strain is now affecting
their nervous systems.

785
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:07,916
They may not know it yet…

786
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,423
but they are dying.

787
00:51:11,916 --> 00:51:16,206

[Mark coughing]

789
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:29,328
[Eak] Titan, how are the others?

790
00:51:31,208 --> 00:51:33,378
[Titan] All too weak to get up except me.

791
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,250
[Phong panting]

792
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:41,376
-Hey, take a break now.
-[Phong] Yeah. Yeah.

793
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:42,378
Go get some water.

794
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:44,748
[Phong weakly] Yeah. [groans softly]

795
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:50,333

[Titan] Aren't you coming?

798
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:05,208
I'm gonna dig a little bit more.

799
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:08,496
[Titan] You need rest too, Eak.

800
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:10,876
[Eak exhales deeply]

801
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:18,916
I've told you about my brother, right?

802
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
My name, Eakaphon…

803
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:30,578
mixes both of our names together.

804
00:52:32,791 --> 00:52:33,831
But he had leukemia.

805
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:38,995
And I watched him die.

806
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:42,166
[poignant music playing]

807
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:49,463
My life changed after that.

808
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:54,626
My mother died.

809
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:57,421
My father died.

810
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:07,753
Right now, Mark isn't doing very well.

811
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:11,745
[voice breaks] You guys are starving.

812
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:16,958
But I won't lose my family again.

813
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:23,665

[Narongsak] <i>The rain is getting worse.</i>

820

And so are the water currents.
It's more dangerous for our divers too.

821
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:19,958
Is there any chance we find them alive?

822
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:26,246
It's been almost nine days
without clean water and food.

823
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:28,575
Sir, we can't lose hope.

824
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:30,418
I'm sorry, sir.

825
00:54:38,583 --> 00:54:40,503
Pull back the divers and my team.

826
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:44,668
I can't risk more men.

Please don't.

I don't even know how I ended up here.

833
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:17,251
Maybe you were led
to be together with me here.

834
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:19,213
Our instincts are good guides.

835
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:23,536
We've met before.

836
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,040
You told me your son
is in the cave, right?

837
00:56:28,291 --> 00:56:29,251
His name is Mark.

838
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:30,958
Mark.

839
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:35,923
You must let me thank you.

840
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:41,036
This is from the monks.

841
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,170

00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:53,583
I can't sleep, like you.

00:56:57,458 --> 00:56:58,918
It's a Shan tradition.

Sand for each boy.

00:57:02,916 --> 00:57:04,206
Twelve in total.

846
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:07,415
And one for Coach Eak.

847
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:09,536
Thirteen.

848
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:11,131
Yes.

849
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:14,826
For me, faith is all that matters.

850
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,630
I don't have money.

851
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:20,166
I don't have power.

852
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:21,786
I only have faith.

853
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:25,078
Faith that my son is in there.

854
00:57:27,416 --> 00:57:28,786
And I'm choosing…

855
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:33,043
to have faith that you will find him.

856
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,880
If I wait for him here,

857
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,713
that you will bring my Mark back.

858
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:39,751
[Namhom sobs]

859
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,328
What is it <i>you</i> believe?

860
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:45,496
I believe in science.

861
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:50,536
But now, science has failed me.

862
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:52,625
[thunder rumbles]

863
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,130
Mother nature is in the way.

864
00:57:57,666 --> 00:58:00,376
I wonder if I really have
offended the gods?

865
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:03,463
I bowed my head to pray!

866
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:07,455
But I couldn't bring myself to believe.

867
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,500
[Namhom] It's a big ask

868
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:12,833
for a man of science to give up

869
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:16,706
and surrender to belief.

870
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:19,918
I'm not proud to admit it…

871
00:58:24,291 --> 00:58:26,171
I'm going to need a miracle here.

872
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,250
[poignant music playing]

873
00:58:30,458 --> 00:58:32,538
So does your son, in there.

874
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:45,916
[poignant music continues]

875
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,000
[people talking excitedly]

876
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:13,036
[muffled chanting]

877
00:59:16,875 --> 00:59:18,875
[crickets chirping]

878
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,330
[phone rings]

879
00:59:30,916 --> 00:59:34,286
-Ranger Pim speaking.
-[Odd] We think we've caught a break.

880
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:37,745
What are we talking here?

881
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:39,003
<i>In millimeters?</i>

882
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,790
<i>How much of a break?</i>

883
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
[silence over telephone]

884
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,463
I want Noon now.

885
00:59:48,541 --> 00:59:49,711
[people softly gasping]

886
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:56,630
Hi, Pim. It's Noon.

887
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:59,831
<i>Trust me. It's not going to rain.</i>

888
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:03,581
[Pim] <i>They're saying no rain</i>
<i>until at least noon.</i>

889
01:00:04,416 --> 01:00:05,786
Probably a little longer.

890
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:08,288
I think we should go for it.

891
01:00:22,041 --> 01:00:24,171
The odds are nearly impossible.

892
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:29,748
But we've all seen statistics
be wrong before.

893
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:35,880
<i>We've all seen the power of the mind</i>
<i>overcome the power of the body.</i>

894
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:38,251
<i>We all have doubts.</i>

895
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:41,168
<i>We all have a crisis of faith.</i>

896
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:45,211
<i>We've all had days of rain that never end.</i>

897
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:47,538
<i>But the rain ended!</i>

898
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,790
<i>It wasn't supposed to.</i>

899
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,790
<i>But it wasn't supposed to start</i>
<i>when the boys entered the cave either.</i>

900
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:58,576
<i>Faith has a way of dealing us a hand</i>

901
01:00:58,666 --> 01:01:00,286
<i>that we don't always want.</i>

902
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:04,995
<i>Challenges we could do without.</i>
<i>But challenges can be opportunities.</i>

903
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:09,536
<i>Maybe you don't believe</i>
<i>you have an opportunity here.</i>

904
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:13,380
<i>Or maybe you believe</i>
<i>it has passed us by already.</i>

905
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,130
Maybe you believe
the boys died on the first day.

906
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:18,745
Or the third day.

907
01:01:19,416 --> 01:01:23,206
Drowned in water or got sick or starved.

908
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,630
But I've seen a shrine
that bloomed in the jungle,

909
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:30,125
filled with offerings.

910
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,580
I've seen Buddhists,

911
01:01:32,666 --> 01:01:35,576
Christians, and animists,

912
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:38,253
heads bowed in prayer.

913
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:41,883
I've even bowed my own.

914
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:47,038
Whatever you believe,

915
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,540
believe in these boys.

916
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:01,253
[John] What is it?

917
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:03,876
[distant muffled voices]

918
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:13,996
[muffled voices continue]

919
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:15,083
[weakly] Biw.

920
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:18,791
Biw. [sighs]

921
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:22,746
[Biw, sleepily] If it's a ghost,
just ignore it.

922
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:27,285
-[Rick] W-- Watch your step.
-[Adul] It's coming from the water.

923
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:30,173
-[muffled voices continue]
-They sound foreign.

924
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,416
[Biw moaning]

925
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:37,495
[voices get louder]

926
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:39,043
Foreign ghosts?

927
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:41,995
-[John] Which direction do you think?
-[Rick] Definitely not behind us.

928
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:44,503
I don't believe in ghosts.

929
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:50,541
[Adul shouting] Hello?

930
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:52,705
Hello?

931
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,170
Hey! Come here! Quick!

932
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,541
[John] Are you a Wild Boar?

933
01:03:04,666 --> 01:03:06,876
-[Adul] English?
-[Rick] Yes. [laughs]

934
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:08,878
-[Adul] You speak English?
-[Rick] Yes!

935
01:03:09,791 --> 01:03:12,001
-[Adul] Where are you from?
-[Rick] The UK!

936
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,380
[John] This is brilliant.

937
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:16,538
[Titan] Where are my parents?
Is there anything to eat?

938
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:19,285
-[Adul] <i>Are there rangers outside?</i>
-[Tle]<i> Is my mom mad at me?</i>

939
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,075
[Tee] <i>Adul, what did he say?</i>

940
01:03:21,166 --> 01:03:22,496
[Tle] What's going on?

941
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:24,043
Did you get lost?

942
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:25,375
[Rick laughing] No.

943
01:03:25,458 --> 01:03:28,498
<i>We're</i> not lost. <i>You're</i> lost.
We've been trying to find you.

944
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:35,921
Say your names.

945
01:03:36,541 --> 01:03:37,381
Here.

946
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:38,828
<i>I'm Adul.</i>

947
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,580
<i>Titan.</i>

948
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:44,495
<i>Phong.</i>

949
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:46,173
<i>Mix.</i>

950
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:48,038
<i>Night.</i>

951
01:03:48,916 --> 01:03:49,746
<i>Dom.</i>

952
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,330
<i>Biw.</i>

953
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:53,963
<i>Tle.</i>

954
01:03:54,958 --> 01:03:55,788
<i>Nick.</i>

955
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,131
<i>Note.</i>

956
01:04:00,166 --> 01:04:03,166
<i>I'm Tee. And this is, um…</i>

957
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:06,455
<i>I'm Mark.</i>

958
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,580
Mark.

959
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:11,456
[inaudible dialogue]

960
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:13,421
[poignant music playing]

961
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:27,750
LIST OF MISSING PEOPLE

962
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:33,083
13. MONGKOL

963
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:52,708
[Rick chuckling] Twelve of you!
How is this possible?

964
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:55,381
[John] <i>Where is your coach? I-- Is he…</i>

965
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,130
<i>Did he survive?</i>

966
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:26,461
[Rick] Coach. [chuckles]

967
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:29,378
We've been searching for you for ten days.

968
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:31,825
[John] We are so glad to find you safe.

969
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,250
We thought you were dead.

970
01:05:35,041 --> 01:05:36,211
How is this possible?

971
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:37,830
He made us dig.

972
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,630
On a strict schedule.

973
01:05:41,291 --> 01:05:44,461
He taught us to fill our bellies
with fresh water.

974
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:48,043
He taught us to meditate

975
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:51,035
to conserve our strength,

976
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:54,291
to focus our minds, and calm us.

977
01:05:55,416 --> 01:05:56,576
And to save your oxygen.

978
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,080
Faith. He never gave up.

979
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:06,245
[John] This… It… [voice quavers]
is simply extraordinary, Coach.

980
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:09,383
You should be proud
for what you have done.

981
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:14,581
[breathes shakily]
What will happen to us now?

982
01:06:15,166 --> 01:06:15,996
[moans softly]

983
01:06:23,958 --> 01:06:24,878
I don't know.

984
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,830
But you saved these boys.

985
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:31,628
Now it's up to all of us

986
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:32,998
to rescue them.

987
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:36,708
[rousing music playing]
