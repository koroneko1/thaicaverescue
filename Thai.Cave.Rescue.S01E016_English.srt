00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,876
We thought we had more time
to teach you how to dive.

3
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:31,748
However, the rescuers have decided
it's better to get you out sooner instead.

4
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:37,126
This means Dr. Harry will be back
with a foreign diver in a few hours.

5
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,576
That means they're going
to start taking you home today.

7
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,786
What do you mean
by things not going as planned?

8
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,825
You <i>will</i> put on a wetsuit, dive gear,

9
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,876
that part is the same.

10
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,668
Then you'll take a relaxer.

11
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,383
It'll be an easy pill to swallow.

12
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,130
Then Dr. Harry will give you
a shot that will put you to sleep.

13
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,705
Then one of the divers
will swim you out of the cave.

14
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:18,961
When you wake up,

15
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,578
you'll finally be outside again.

16
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,133
They should let us practice a little more.

17
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,128
Even I'm getting better at diving now.

18
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,080
[Bhak] We know, but the cave is…

19
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,998
It's more challenging than we realized.

20
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,416
The last thing we want

21
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,630
is to put you in a position
you are not prepared for.

22
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,496
These divers are complete experts.

23
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,383
They're the best in the world.

24
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,538
And they already figured everything out.

25
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:55,245
This is a good way
to get everyone out of here

26
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,583

27
00:01:56,666 --> 00:02:00,166

30
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:10,458
So I thought

31
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,253
<i>you</i> should have the right to choose.

32
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,293
Talk it over with Coach Eak.

33
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,575
Let me know what you decide.

34
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,246
No rush. Take your time.

35
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:23,955
Okay?

36
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,038

38
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,500
The fairest way would probably be
to go from oldest to youngest.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,210
I agree.

40
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,133
Or youngest to oldest?

41

Then, I wanna go first.

This plan is the last option.

55

It's the best option,

56
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,830

177
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:40,786
Let's get his gear on.

178
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,628
Okay. You give him the pill.

00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,456

[Eak] Everyone.

183
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,710
Gather around.

184
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:03,673
You ready?

185
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,745
One, two, three!

186
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,293

[Note] Thanks, guys.

190
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,828
See you outside. Okay?

191
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,208
[SEAL] Take it easy.

192
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,628
Slowly.

193
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,830
[Harry] Here we go.
Nice and easy. Here we go.

194
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,133
Okay. I'm gonna give you a jab in the leg.

195
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,456
[SEAL] He's giving you an injection.

196
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,833
You may feel a little sting,
but you'll be okay.

197
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,173
You ready?

198
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,710
[Baitoey] It'll be okay.

199
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,708
You'll be all right.

200
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,035
Go home and see Mum and Dad
very soon, okay?

201
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,455
Here we go.

202
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,288
Off we go.

203
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,878
Lay him down first. Hold tight.

204
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,786
-[SEAL] Here.
-For the feet.

205
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,576
Hold his head.

206
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,785
One. Two.

207
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,830
Three.

208
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,541
Four.

209
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,825
-Go on. Breathe, kid, breathe.
-[Harry] Five.

210
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,673
-Six.
-What's he doing, Doc?

211
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,580
[Harry] Seven…

212
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,996
Even unconscious, the body will
automatically hold its breath underwater.

213
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,833
[Harry sighs] Okay.

214
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,206
Let's get him hooked up.

215
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,963
Craig'll be in the next chamber
to check his vitals

216
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,751
and top him up if need be.

217
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,246
[Bhak] Get set.

218
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,376
Remember the only way this works
is to keep moving forward.

219
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,035

[sirens wailing]

258
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,326
[Biw's dad] They brought out
five boys alive so far.

259
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,376
They won't say who, but there's a problem.

I got him to talk.

263

He told me…

264
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,793
they didn't have a mask
for the smallest boy.

265
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,126
[Tai emotionally] Titan.

266
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,285
[Biw's mom] Tai, take it easy.

267
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,875
Titan is the youngest,
but you think he's the smallest?

268
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:38,923
He isn't.

269

Night's too.

276
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,166
But it isn't as bad as Mark's yet.

277
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,211
[Harry] Well, he's older and stronger.

278

[Mark] What about the rest of us?

284
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,958
You will go out tomorrow morning.

[Bhak] Let's go.

292
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,078
[mumbling] Mom,

293
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,705
save me some SpongeBob.

294
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:22,166
[chuckles] Did he say
something about SpongeBob?

295
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,460
All right, let's go!

296
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,293
I think he'll be okay,
but keep an eye on his breath. Set?

297
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:34,825
See you out there.

298
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:42,785
So far…

299
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,248
this is our best option.

300
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,996
It looks like a kid's toy.

301
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:50,995
[Charles] It's worse.

302
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,213
That's not a positive-pressure mask.

303
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,495
It's the only thing we found that'll

304
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,576
fit over his face.

305
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,043
We have to give
the divers a break tonight,

306
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,245
but we should be able to rig it
so that it holds tight by morning.

307
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,173
That long?

308
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,250
[Appakorn] The divers have been
in the cave for 12 hours.

309
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,333
They are exhausted.

310
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,750
If we push them any further,
we will increase the risk factor.

311
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,171
[Mark coughs]

312
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,211
What if they don't come back for us?

313
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,831
No way, man.
They're not gonna leave us in here, Mark.

314
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,166
[yells] I didn't say
they'd do it on purpose!

315
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,630
They're hiding how bad it is
'cause they don't wanna scare us!

316
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,918
You don't have to yell at Phong
because <i>you're</i> scared!

317
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,210
I'm not scared!

318
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,671
[mocking Mark]

319
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,830
-[Mark grunts]
-[Eak] That's enough! Mark!

320
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:42,746
That's it.

321
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,173
You too.

322
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,668
We are in this together

323
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,415
until the very end.

324
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,288
Understood?

325
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,461
[Mark coughing]

326
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,126
[diver] What's wrong with him?

327
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,828
I swam as hard as I could.
Couldn't feel him breathing.

328
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,996
-Is he the one that's sick?
-His nose is definitely blocked.

329
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,210
[Craig] Hey, Terry! Move!

330
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,171
-[Harry] What's happening?
-[Craig] He's barely breathing.

331
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,710
[Harry] Craig, did you administer
any more drugs?

332
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,421
-[Craig] No.
-[Harry] Okay, good.

333
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,076
Tilt his chin up.

334
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,036
Keep his airways open.

335
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,706
Has anyone got a blanket?

336
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,705
[Rick] Too much on the first dose?

337
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,288
Maybe.

338
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Hard to say, really.

339
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,746
He does have a chest infection
I may have underestimated.

340
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,673
Need to get his core temperature up.

341
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,705
Craig, we'll do a breath count.

342
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,331
-[watch beeps]
-One. Two. Three.

343
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,165
-Come on, kid.
-[Craig] Four. Five. Six.

344
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,290
-[Harry] That's one.
-Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.

345
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,415

Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen.

346
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,380

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,670
Okay, breathing's stable.
That'll have to do.

351
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,790
Let's move!

352
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,460
What if I have to give him
another dose on the way?

353
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,671
-Then, you give him another dose.
-If he stops breathing again?

354
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,750
Look, the best chance he's got
is to get him outta here

355
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,003
as fast as possible.

356
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:29,631
[Rick] Okay.

357
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,075
[suspenseful music playing]

358
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,253
[Luke] Fish on the line!

359
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,131

00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,330
[suspenseful music continues]

362
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,291

[siren wailing]

364
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,378
[man, in Thai] Here comes a Wild Boar!

365
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:17,668
[in Thai] Here he comes.

366
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,210

[music climaxing]

369
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,326
[Harry gasping] What's happening?

370
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:52,326
Night's still breathing.
We're getting him to the hospital now.

371
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:53,963
[Harry sighs]

we brought him out tonight.

381
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:24,786
I almost couldn't save him.

382
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:28,666
The little one, Mark,
his chest infection is even worse.

383
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,330
I don't know whether
I can go back in again,

384
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:32,916
knowing he probably won't make it.

385
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,626
I mean, I've lost patients before, but…

<i>We don't make a habit</i>

387
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:45,375
You know, I was thinking
about that day on the boat as a kid.

388
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:51,828
I really do have a habit of biting off
more than I can chew, don't I?

389
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,326
<i>You think that's why</i>

<i>anyone can get lost at sea, Son.</i>

393
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,461
<i>Nothing special about that.</i>

394
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,580
<i>But you…</i>

395
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,833
<i>You went out on that boat again</i>
<i>after you had the crap scared out of you.</i>

396
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:13,246
<i>Thought you were gonna be fish food.</i>
<i>And you went diving again.</i>

397
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:17,171
<i>Now that's when I knew</i>
<i>what sort of a man you were gonna be.</i>

398
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:23,288
Hey, listen,

399
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:26,625
the nurse told me that you had a fall,
and you didn't remember it.

400
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,713
Dad, you could've had a stroke.
You should've told me.

401
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:33,001
<i>Why? You'd be on the next plane back.</i>

402
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,750
<i>So you can faff off about this</i>
<i>nursing home,</i>

<i>We all know I'm gonna be fine.</i>

405
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,210
<i>Now stop worrying about me,</i>
<i>and start worrying about</i>

406
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:46,131
<i>whether you're gonna go down</i>
<i>that cave again tomorrow or not.</i>

407
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,581
It's not like they're gonna
leave you here by yourself, Mark.

408
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,463
Leave me alone, Titan.

409
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,293
Whoa! That's amazing.

410
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,421
Wild Boar roster for all time?

411
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,495
Do my name at the top!

412
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:17,878
[moodily] It's in order
of who's getting rescued.

413
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:22,133
Never mind, then.
All right, put me on last.

414
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,575
For me, it's not the worst to go last.

415
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:26,996
Oh yeah?

416
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,383
So brave of you not to be afraid at all.

417
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:32,246
That's right. I'm a badass.

418
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:35,633
You have no idea
what it's like being the last to go.

419
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:39,423
Or to be looked at
like you're weak when you're not.

420
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:46,131
Just once, I wanted to prove
that I'm actually brave enough.

421
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:47,665
But now…

422
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,248
I may never get out of here.

[Kelly] <i>In the next couple of hours,</i>

429
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:48,126
it'll pummel the divers.

430
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:52,245
At this rate,

431
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,213
the smaller chambers
will flood completely.

432
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:59,208
Those who dive in tomorrow
may never come out.

[thunder rumbling]

435
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:02,665
[solemnly] The risk-reward ratio
has tipped against us,

00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,830
leaving us to face a stark choice.

437
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:09,956
No one's leaving those boys to die.

00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,791
[tense music playing]

439
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,876
The rising water is going to change
the topography of the swim.

440
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:27,328
There'll be new chambers
you could get lost in,

441
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,626
passages may become blocked with sand.

442
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,578
Even if you're just prepping air tanks,

443
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:35,326
this will be
the most dangerous water we've faced.

444
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:38,076
[Charles] First kid took
nearly five hours to get out.

445
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,536
By the end of the day,
we had that down to almost two.

446
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:45,035
If we have any chance at all
to beat this storm,

447
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:49,536
today… we need to do that in 90 minutes.

448
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,576
[Bhak] The cave is flooding.

449
00:28:57,083 --> 00:29:00,713
And with the coming storm,
every second counts.

450
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,381
Circumstances have changed.

451
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,128
You <i>must</i> go now.

452
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,460
You need to leave
while the divers still have the strength

453
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:09,251
to carry your weight out of here.

454
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,580
We had an agreement.

455
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,876
I would go last
in case something went wrong.

456
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,205
[Bhak] I know.

457
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:17,916
You know if something happens,

458
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,456
they will all understand.

459
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,711
I promised to keep them all safe.

460
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:24,205
[Bhak] Eak,

461
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:26,375
you're a hero.

462
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:29,291
The boys all believe it.

463
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,833
And we all do too.

464
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:34,416

it's your coach's turn.

467
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:40,785
But your coach refuses to leave.

468
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,671
Help me here.

469
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,580
-[Tee] Please go, Eak.
-[Titan] Come on, Eak.

470
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,036
[Phong] You have to.

471
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,415
[Mark] Please go, Eak.

472
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,330
Don't worry about us. We'll be okay.

473
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:50,246
[Bhak] See?

474
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,878
None of them hesitated.

475
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:57,748
Eak, it's time to go.

476
00:29:58,333 --> 00:29:59,173
Now.

477
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:01,706
We'll see you on the other side.

478

481
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,460
[Bhak] Here.

482
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:32,543
-[Tee] Don't worry.
-[Titan] Keep it up. You can do this.

483
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,630
You can do this.

484
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,038
[Mark] Don't worry, coach.

485
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:39,786
[Titan] Fight on.

486
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:45,581
[Bhak sniffs]

487
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:48,416
-[Phong] Good luck.
-[Titan] Good luck. You can do this.

[Eak softly] See you soon. [sniffs]

[Eak breathing shakily]

493
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:30,826
See you soon.

494
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,381
[Bhak muffled] Harry, you okay?

495
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:09,631
Harry?

496
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:11,881
Yeah.

497
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:25,131
You got kids?

498
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:27,038
A son.

499
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,080
What would you tell him if you knew
he might not get out of this cave?

500
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:39,246
I'd do what every parent would do.

501
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,496
I'd tell him not to worry.

502
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:47,955
Yeah.

503
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,580
What's wrong?

504
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,420
What's wrong with <i>you</i>?

505
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,245
I'm afraid of drowning.

506
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:26,416
You may drown here,
but it's better to try.

507
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:29,921
I'm gonna hug my mom, eat real food, and--

508
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,830
Take a bath?

509
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:34,828
Wouldn't you risk the possibility

510
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:37,963
of maybe being able
to do those things again,

511
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,075
rather than sitting here

512
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:42,825
and worrying about what might happen?

513
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,173
[Bhak] Titan.

514
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,080
You're up.

515
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:54,333
[Mark] My mother once told me

516
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:57,126
that courage isn't about not being afraid,

517
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:58,708
you can be afraid,

518
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,333
but you still keep moving.

519
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:17,576
I left you something over there.

520
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,791
[Mark crying softly]

521
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:49,381

00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,293
[Bhak] <i>I can't guarantee</i>
<i>that you're going to make it.</i>

524
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,173
<i>But the water is rising.</i>

525
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:10,955
<i>If you stay here,</i>
<i>I can guarantee that you will die.</i>

526
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:14,536
<i>We have to go, Titan.</i>

527
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,670
<i>Think of home.</i>

528
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:19,826
[Harry] Okay, he's out.

529
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:24,376
What's all this?

530
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:25,878
[men chuckling]

531
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,708
There's gotta be four or five of them.

532
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,748
-Cool Ranch Dorito MREs.
-[Harry chuckles]

533
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,665
[diver chuckling]

534
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:42,916
[Harry] Need a breather?

535
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,880
[Rick] No.

536
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:46,378
Water's starting to push back
at the T-junction.

537
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:48,415
We've got to go.

538
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,380
[Harry] Okay. Let's move.

539
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,790

[music intensifying]

542
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:04,461
[music stops]

543
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:15,833
[Harry] There we go.

544
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:22,041
[Harry struggling with mask straps]

545
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,036
Take it off.

546
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:45,541
[mask being removed]

547
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:52,576
[Harry] Where's that foam?

548
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:56,286
[Baitoey] Listen to me, Mark.
This will hurt a little.

549
00:36:56,375 --> 00:37:00,165
We have to make sure this will work.
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?

550
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,375
[Harry] Hold it there.

551
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,173
[Baitoey] Okay.

552
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,630
You good?

553
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,540
[Harry] Sorry we haven't got something
better for you.

554
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,420
[Mark] Well, Dr. Harry, I'm ready now.

555
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:30,575
I'm ready to go.

556
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:35,083
Let's find out our fate.

557
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:38,881
[Bhak sighs] He…

558
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:40,285
He's ready.

559
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,710
We have to find out our fate.

560
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:54,001
He's right.

561
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:03,628
Think it's about time
we all left this cave.

562
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,880
There's no pressure in the mask, Doc.
If water gets in, he'll drown.

563
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:13,208
We'd best keep him steady, then.

564
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,173
Yeah.

565
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:24,878
[Harry] Good boy.

566
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,125
I can do this.

567
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:46,325
Best get your own gear on.

568
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:48,956
Don't worry. We're right behind you.

569
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:53,128
We're moving.

570
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:55,708
John's heading Mark
over to David in chamber 6,

571
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,211
so they don't lose time
on the cylinder change.

572
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:00,748
[Harry] What the hell
are you still doing here?

573
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:02,423
I'm waiting for you, of course.

574
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:04,293
[Harry] That was dumb.

575
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:16,541
[tense dramatic music playing]

576
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,540
<i>Our sources on the ground have confirmed</i>

577
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:32,325
<i>conditions in the cave</i>

578
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:37,043

579
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:42,331
<i>Sources claim that there's an issue</i>
<i>with the smallest boy's mask,</i>

580
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,880
<i>although what that means</i>
<i>for the rescue is still unclear.</i>

00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,830

[David groans]

584
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:05,458
[Harry] Hey! Let's get moving.

585
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:07,788
We're still waiting on the last boy.

586
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:11,165
The last boy? No, he was in front of me.

587
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,830
He hasn't come through yet.

588
00:40:13,416 --> 00:40:16,076
Okay. Everyone. Out of here. Now.

589
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:18,826
Harry! Mate! You can't go back.

590
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,826
If you run into Bhak or a SEAL,
you'll get yourself killed.

591
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:22,916
Appakorn was right.

592
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,420
Half of the chambers
are almost flooded already.

593
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:29,418
Get moving.

594
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,375
[suspenseful music playing]

595
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:46,421

[suspenseful music continues]

597
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:35,208
-Fish on!
-[Craig] All right, let's go!

598
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,875
-[Luke] Baitoey! We got Baitoey!
-[Baitoey gasping]

599
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:46,876
-[SEAL] Yeah?
-[Baitoey] Yeah.

600
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:52,503
[chuckles with relief]

601
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:58,043
[David] I hit a sandbar
and just about drowned him.

602
00:41:58,125 --> 00:41:59,785
[Harry] Look, it happens.

603
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:03,251
Water levels are rising.
Plugs are all over the place.

604
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:05,213
-[David sighs]
-Are you all right?

605
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:06,995
[David] The kid.

606
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:09,536
His breathing's so shallow.

607
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:14,538
He's gonna need another dose.

608
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:18,331
He'll stop breathing.

609
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:19,956
At this stage,

610
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:23,205
he's more likely to wake
and kill you both.

611
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,631
[David chuckles anxiously]

612
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:28,955
Hey. Hey.

613
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:32,423
Hey.

614
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:33,955
Listen.

615
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:36,923
I'm gonna take him, okay?

616
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:40,383
Find the guideline.

617
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:43,078
Close your eyes.
The water and silt will only distract you.

618
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:46,833
Close your eyes,
and you feel for that rope, okay?

619
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:48,286
-[David] All right.
-Off you go.

620
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:49,205
[David] Okay.

621
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:05,631
All right, Mark.

622
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,830
Don't stop breathing on me now.

[SEAL] Good luck.

628
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:01,128
[Luke] Welcome back, Mike.

629
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,503
There's Bhak.
We've got all the SEALs back.
