[Tee] Hey, Biw.
Should I be worried about you?

00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,251
Just hold on.

What's going on?

7
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,378
Biw is taking
the longest pee in existence.

-[Biw] I have to get permission first.

10
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,420
I don't want the princess
to get even more angry.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,580
[Eak] Baitoey's serving breakfast.

12
00:00:58,666 --> 00:00:59,916
[Biw] Let's go, Tee.

13
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,133
[Tee] Hey, wait for me. Biw, wait.

14
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:09,883
[Tee] Aren't you hungry?

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,580
Not right now.
I'd rather pray while it's quiet.

16
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,423
You better hurry,
before Titan eats all the food.

-Hm?

19
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,750
The SEALs are back.

20
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:35,883
-Really?
-Yeah.

21
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:39,325
That's good. Finally. Let's go.

[Aran] <i>They found a way</i>

I haven't been able
to get the coach to eat anything.

26
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,078
I didn't know what to say.

27
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:58,248
When he saw how low we were on food,
he insisted we give his share to the boys.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
These are letters to the boys' families.

29
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,753
And a message for the governor.
It's critical.

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,500
Okay.

31
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,038
Hey, Aran.

32
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,785
What's the, uh, plan
to get the boys out of here?

33
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,916
[unsettling music playing]

34
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:32,463
Unfortunately, our worst scenario
is now our best option.

35
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:36,461
We have reviewed the alternatives,
including inflating a flexible tunnel,

36
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,581
and we have concluded
that teaching these boys to scuba dive

37
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,326
is the most realistic option.

38
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:45,996
I have asked Major Hensen and his team
to put together a course-of-action plan.

39
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,043
-Major.
-Thank you, Admiral.

40
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:53,128
We've broken this operation down
into a series of manageable chunks

41
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,708
so we can approach
the problem step by step.

42
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,041
How long will it take?

43
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,208
It's hard to say right now.

44
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,961
We're already gathering gear.

45
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,041
We've put out a call for more tanks.

46
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,165
We need 600 to complete the mission.

47
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,540
We have 200 on site,
plus a promise of another 200.

48
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,955
That leaves us 200 short.

49
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,171
And we still have to prep the cave

50
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,330
to have enough oxygen for the boys
and their divers to swim out.

51
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:19,036
We're gonna have to pre-stage tanks
in each of the chambers between the sumps.

52
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,665
They'll change tanks as they come out.

53
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,670
Not to mention
teach 13 half-starved young men

54
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,420
how to scuba dive through some
of the ugliest conditions I've ever seen.

55
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,955
[John] That is not something
that can happen overnight.

56
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,831
You must have some idea of a time frame.

57
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,126
-Three weeks, minimum.
-Possibly four.

58
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,461
[Chet] Governor.

59
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,535
From Dr. Pak.

60
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,458
He says the boys
are running out of oxygen.

61
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,291
He was worried this would happen.

62
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:58,206
Normally, the air we breathe
is around 21% oxygen by volume.

63
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,576
Anything below 19.5%
is considered oxygen-deficient.

64
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:07,671
Now, once you get below 15%,
you're at risk for developing hypoxia.

65
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,956
Which means diminished mental capacity,

66
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,541
lowered heart rates, loss of coordination,

67
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,710
and eventually death.

68
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,625
The doctor says
the chamber is at 16% oxygen.

69
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,131
Chet, what does it mean for us?

70
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,458
[Chet sighs]

71
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:34,078
Well, based on the levels we measured
on our first run of supplies,

72
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:38,666
we estimate the chamber
will drop below 15% in less than a week.

73
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,043
So we finally get the water levels down,

74

<i>find a way to keep them fed,</i>

75
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,290
<i>and now they may suffocate.</i>

77
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,286
It's settled, then.

78
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,833
You must speed up our rescue timeline.

79
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,833
You don't get four weeks, or three.

80
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,333
You have one.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,830
Only one.

The sea turtle who died
after swallowing 915 coins.

So much suffering.

104
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:40,325
I hate the thought of someone suffering
for good fortune. [scoffs]

If we've trained hard enough to win,
then we'll win no matter what.

Okay.

131

Chet told me they need more oxygen.

and have them sent up to Tham Luang.

Hmm.

[Kelly] <i>The pumps are working</i>

137

Almost too well.

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,830
We're expelling
1.6 million liters per hour.

139
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,083
At that rate, is it possible
to drain the cave completely?

140
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,793
So we can get the water low enough
to get more air in?

141
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,583
No.

142
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,501
Especially not with this rain
still coming down.

143
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:38,578
But I'm confident that we can keep
the water level safe for divers

144
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,036
as long as we need to.

145
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,963
The problem is…

146
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,876
The problem is

147
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,078
we're hours away from running out
of places to dump the water.

148
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,825
[Pim] There aren't many options
in this area.

149
00:08:56,541 --> 00:09:00,791
Especially because the ground
is already oversaturated from the rain.

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,750
So where does that leave us?

151

[foreboding music playing]

152
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,376
We can flood this farmland.

153
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,828
It's in Mae Sai.

154
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:19,536
There's more than enough space to hold
the amount of water we're anticipating.

155
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,921
But we'll destroy all their crops.

156
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,825
It'll be a huge sacrifice for them.

157
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,043
We have two enemies right now.

00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,041
He's legendary and tough.

175
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,875
He's in better shape in retirement
than most of you are right now.

176
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,038
Leave me alone, Chet.

177
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,461
-Leave them alone too.
-[Chet] Ah, come on!

178
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,171
How about we put 'em
in a pool full of ice, huh?

179
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,956
Like you did with me.

180
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,211
-[Chet laughs] Legendary.
-All right, guys. Let's go!

181
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,211
[Chet laughs]

182
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,541
[loudspeaker announcement in Thai]

183
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,713
What does Tee look like?

184
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:37,831
He's tall.

185
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,206
-Okay. Tall.
-[man] Pink!

186
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,791
-[Pink] Yeah.
-Pink. You can't run off like that.

187
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,415
I have to know where you are.

188
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,420
But he's going to see Tee
and deliver a message for me.

189
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,130
Tell Tee, if he ever gets trapped
in a cave again, I'll kill him!

190
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,963
Okay, I will.

191
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,671
I'll deliver the message for you.

192
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,790
[Pink] Okay.

193
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,995
So Tee is your son, then?

194
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,963
He is. Are you going to see him now?

195
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,041
[Aran] Yes.

196
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,423
Please tell our son
that we love him very much.

197
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,080
[man] Tell him not to worry.
Just take care of himself.

198
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,496
I will.

199
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,673
[softly] Okay.

200
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,750
See you.

201
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,378
[Note] I see something moving
under the water.

202
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,575
[dramatic musical flourish]

203
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:33,996
I'm serious.

204
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,166
Did you see that?

205
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,746
It's humungous. It's gigantic.

206
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,711
What if

207
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,080
it's the water dragon?

208
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,288
-[screaming]
-[yells in fright]

209
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,375
[mock yelling]

210
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,745
-Dude! Not cool.
-[laughing]

211
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,538
[boys shout]

212
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,293
Morning, Wild Boars. Oh.

213
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,915
[Rick] How many of you can swim?

214
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,206
[Aran] Adul, did your friends
get what he said?

215
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,171
He wants to know if we can swim.

216
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,960
[all boys] I can! Me too!

217
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,631
And have any of you
ever been scuba diving?

218
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,418
He's asking if we can scuba dive.

219
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,500
[boys murmur]

220
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:22,498
Okay. I'd say today is your lucky day.

221
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,423
Today, you officially start
SEAL Dive Training boot camp.

222
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,580
Whoa!

223
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,826
So awesome!

224
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,036
Does that mean
we're going to dive out of here?

225
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:33,673
Yes.

226
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,495
-We're diving?
-Hey, guys.

227
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:44,575
They wouldn't ask
if they thought it was hard for us.

228
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,036
[boy] Yeah, I agree with Tee.

229
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,501
That's right.

230
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,673
So let's get started.

231
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,830
These two, Rick and John,

232
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,246
are gonna start fitting you guys
for your scuba gear.

233
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,503
Then we'll jump in, okay?

234
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,583
-All right.
-Okay.

235
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,706
-Okay.
-Okay.

236
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:00,881
Ready, guys?

237
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:01,998
-[Aran] Great.
-All right.

238
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,248
[all boys] Thank you, Teacher.

239
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,830
Okay, so this is a mask.

240
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,496
It goes on your face like this.

241
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,963
-You try.
-Uh, he means me? All right.

242
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,671
This is called a regulator.
It goes in your mouth.

243
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,920
Remember, don't bite.

244
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,130
-[Aran] Mm?
-[Tee] Mm.

245
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:24,041
You attach the oxygen tank here.
First, you put it over the tank like this.

246
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:28,455
Then, you pull the strap
until it makes a locking sound.

247
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,331
[Aran] Okay, try it.

248
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,746
Keep in mind, don't bite. Okay?

249
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,633
-Okay, yeah.
-[Aran] Good.

250
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,538
Go.

251
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,205
Hey! Hey, Titan!

252
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,131
-[Eak laughs]
-[laughing] Hey!

253
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,208
[playful music playing]

254
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,040
-Good?
-Good work. Doing good.

255
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,375
[boys laughing]

256
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,748
You can adjust them.

257
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:55,995
Good? Oh!

258
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,383
[boys] Mark! Mark!

259
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,830
[John] You all right? Yeah.

260
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,956
[boys laughing]

261
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,331
[laughter continues]

262
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,915

264

<i>People are showing up from everywhere.</i>

265
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,745
<i>It's not just rescue workers here.</i>

266
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,875
<i>Here. I'll show you.</i>

267
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,785
<i>Barbers are giving free haircuts, see?</i>

<i>Massages in this tent.</i>
<i>Free massages for anyone.</i>

269
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,415
You can have your laundry done here.
[chuckles] It's crazy.

270
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,420
Here are some donated items.

271
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,580
Rain boots, jackets,
toothpaste, toothbrushes. All free.

272
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,038
<i>Can you believe this?</i>

273
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,080
<i>So many people have come here,</i>
<i>willing to drop everything</i>

274
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,666
<i>to help these boys.</i>

275
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:52,633
Wow! Those people are really incredible
for helping out.

276
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,538
[train announcement in Thai]

277
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,285
-Honey, I'm almost at work now.
-[Sam] <i>I see.</i>

278
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,625
Don't let Chet
work you too hard, okay, honey?

279
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,246
[Sam] <i>I won't.</i>

280
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,633
We're just filling oxygen tanks

281
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,628
and putting them in the cave.

282
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,078
Then I'll be on the next flight back.

283
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,456
-Easy-peasy.
-[Meow laughs]

284
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,751
Of course. Only you would say
it will be easy.

285
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,706
Return safely, okay?

286
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:21,831
Okay.

287
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,036
[Meow] <i>All right. Bye for now.</i>

288
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,125
[eerie music playing]

289
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,286
[thunder rumbles]

290
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,713
[man] <i>My crop is just five weeks old.</i>

291
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,828
If you flood my field,
the rice won't survive.

292
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,916
I understand your concerns, really.

293
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,076
And if there were another way
to manage the water,

294
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,786
we would do it, without question.

295
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,461
[man 2] I've been watching
what's been going on.

296
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,248
My heart breaks for the boys
and their families too.

297
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,543
But I have my own family
to take care of too.

298
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,325
[farmers murmur in agreement]

299
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,826
We understand.

300
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,833
We know we're asking a lot from you.

301
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,710
But if we don't do this,
then the cave will remain flooded.

302
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,538
The divers will be unable
to reach the boys.

303
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,915
And the boys

304
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,246
will never make it out of the cave.

305
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,625
[man 3] What about our paddies? Our lives?

306
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,748
[man 4] Yeah. How are we supposed
to live if our crops die?

307
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,705
You can flood my rice paddies.

308
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,251
[poignant music playing]

309
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,543
This country can easily grow more rice.

310
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,415
But we can't regrow the lives
of these young, innocent boys.

311
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,495
-[man] She's right.
-[man] I think I'm gonna sign.

312
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,963
[woman] Let's do as she said.

313
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,541
-[woman] We should all help out.
-[man] Okay, I'll sign.

314
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,165
-[man] We gotta get them out of there.
-[man] We gotta help them.

315
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,211
[woman] Let's all sign it then. Here.

316
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,421
[man] We'll sign right now.

00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,826
-[farmers murmuring]
-[man] Hand it over here. I'll sign.

321
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:38,326
[man] We all need to sign. Everybody.

322
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,876
What if was your son? What would you do?

323
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,038
Come on. Sign it right now.

324
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,915
I'm willing. We need to save these boys.

325
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,670
We need two volunteers.

326
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,080
Good.

327
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,786
Coach, leading the way.

328
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,003
All right. Who else?

329
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,961
-I'll go.
-Come on.

330
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,125
-What's your name?
-It's Tee.

331
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,578
[boy] Well, if Tee is doing it,
then I will too.

332
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,126
Oh! Our famous team captain!

333
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,958
I met your little sister earlier.

334
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,001
She told me she misses you.

335
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,921
-That doesn't sound like her at all.
-[chuckles]

336
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,830
You're right, but you know,

337
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:20,286
your dad did tell me to tell you
not to worry about the family.

338
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,173
Focus on taking good care of yourself.

339
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,711
My dad is out there too?

340
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,333
Yes.

341
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,576
Okay, first lesson is the most important.

342
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,206
[speech fades]
Never hold your breath underwater.

343
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,581
You could pop your lungs
like a balloon if you do that, so…

[contemplative music playing]

345
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:46,416
[muffled] The most important thing to do
is to breathe normally, always.

346
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:51,706
[Aran] Here.

347
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,415
Ready, Tee?

348
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
[boys chattering]

349
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,713
[John] You good?

350
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,126
[John] And breathe.

351
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,538
[inhales and exhales]

352
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,746
[breathing evenly]

353
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,500
[muffled shout, breathing rapidly]

354
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,165
[muffled shout]

355
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,253
[Tee coughing] I can't take it anymore.

356
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,673
-[John] Come on out.
-[Aran] Okay.

357
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,500
-[Tee coughing]
-It's okay. That's enough for now.

358
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,423
There's a lot of equipment to get used to.

359
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,540
We will support you
until you can do it yourself.

360
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,535
Okay.

361
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,915
All right. Who's next, then?

362
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:02,918
[Pim] They all agreed.

363
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,125
Kelly.

364
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,250
This has to be done.

365
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,286
What if these farmers give up everything…

366
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,916
and it's still not enough?

367
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,125
[poignant music playing]

368
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,826
[Pim] We will train the boys to dive.

369
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,326
We <i>will </i>find a way.

370
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,083
[Pim] I'm headed back to camp.

371
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:57,833
Want a lift?

372
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,078
I've gotta get the pump crew started. Uh…

373
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,786
They can work through the night
to reroute the pipes.

374
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,083
I'll catch you tomorrow.

375
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,750
See you tomorrow.

376
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,956
[rescue crew chatting]

377
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,383
So, how are you two old-timers
holding up with the work?

378
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,458
-Can't break us, Chet.
-[Chet chuckles]

379
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,961
If you're up for it,
I'd love to give the new guys a break.

380
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,541
They've been going nonstop.

381
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,785
[man shouts instructions in Thai]

382
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,455
What do you say?

383
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,250
Hooyah!

384
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,286
-Of course. Let's go.
-[Chet] Okay, then.

385
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,625
You'll drop your tanks
at chamber number six.

386
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,383
Okay, follow me.

387
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,421
A guide rope will lead you straight there.

388
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,960
And whatever you do,
do not let go of the rope.

389
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,671
There's almost zero visibility.

390
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,576
Pace yourself. Don't rush.

391
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,166
You'll see a green guide rope
on the way out.

392
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,883
Why green?

393
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,875
When you hit green,
you only have 20 meters left to go.

394
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,578
But be warned.
This isn't Phuket. Not by any means.

395
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,126
-Oh.
-You'll get some bruises.

396
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,288
-[diver grunts]
-[Sam] Hey!

397
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,455
[Buddy] Oh, hey.

398
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,750
It's okay. Just breathe.

399
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,785
Okay.

400
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,626
[Chet] It's going to be okay.

401
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,418
-Hold on. Okay, up.
-[diver grunts]

402
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,920
-One, two, up!
-[grunting]

403
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,210
Watch your head. Watch your head.

404
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,211
[Sam] Medic! We have an injured SEAL here.

405
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:47,881
[woman speaking in Thai]

406
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,381
[generator starts]

407
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,540
[vehicle engine roars]

408
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,455
[engine stops]

409
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,416
[man] Good afternoon. I'm from Phetchabun.

410
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,080
I saw online
you needed 20-inch pump pipes,

411
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,076
so I brought some over.

412
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,745
-Phetchabun?
-Yes, Phetchabun.

413
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,793
You must have driven a long way.

414
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,665
Yes, it's about an eight-hour drive.

415
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:40,251
[thunder rumbles]

416
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,333
[rain falling]

417
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:58,213
[Titan] What do you have to do
to become a SEAL?

418
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:00,541
[Mike] In your case?
Grow another 30 centimeters.

419
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,875
And put on about 40 kilos, give or take.

420
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:05,995
Is that all?

421
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:07,383
[Mike] More or less.

422
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,210
[Baitoey] All right, boys.

423
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:15,626
Okay, so who else wants
some more of the same, hmm?

424
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:17,628
Come on, Tee. You up for another dive?

425
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:20,878
I'm all in.

426
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:23,628
Anything to get me away
from Titan and his loud mouth.

427
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,753
[Tee] Dom, you're up next. Biw, you too.

428
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:27,753
What the heck?

429
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,713
-[air tank hisses]
-[Baitoey] All right, boys.

430
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:33,001
Let's go over the three golden rules
of diving one more time.

431
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,670
-The first and most important rule is--
-I know!

432
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,130
Never hold your breath underwater?

433
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:38,708
Yeah, correct.

434
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:41,581
[Baitoey] The second
is how to clear your regulator.

435
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,996
-[Dom] What's the third?
-[Baitoey] Slow down.

436
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,083
When you get the hang of one and two,
you get three.

437
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:47,166
Okay.

438
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,293
Who wants to be the first to go this time?

439
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:53,286
Yeah, I can swim.

440
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:55,996
-[boy 1] How about me?
-[boy 2] Come on, Tee.

441
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,580
[boy 3] Come on.

442
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,790
It's my time.

443
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:03,288
Come, Tee.

444
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:06,375
[tense music playing]

445
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:20,035
[inhales]

446
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,881
[Baitoey] Go slowly.

447
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:35,876
[Baitoey] This is the way
to get you out of the cave.

448
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:37,498
[water bubbling]

449
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:39,463
[Baitoey] It's the only way home.

450
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:41,416
[spluttering]

451
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,130
[panting]

452
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,080
[Aran] Take it easy, Tee.

453
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,543
[vehicle engine roars]

454
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:57,035
All the farmers have agreed
to let us flood their rice paddies,

455
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:59,495
which covers an area of over 1,600 <i>rai</i>.

456
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:02,673
Water levels in the cave
were stable for 32 hours.

457
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:04,211
Anything else?

458
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,001
We got good news from Chamber Nine.

459
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:09,293
We checked the atmospheric indicator.
The oxygen levels were as we expected.

460
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,535
Therefore, everything
can proceed as planned.

461
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:14,495
As for the bad news,
I'll leave it for Rick and John to report.

462
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,210
He says you can give me the bad news.

463
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:21,381
I'm less convinced the boys can do
the dive out than I was yesterday.

464
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:22,878
It's too much, too fast.

465
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:25,826
[John] Even the team captain
seems on edge.

466
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:32,333
Uh, I just finished counting
what inventory isn't already in the cave.

467
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:34,036
We're short on tanks.

468
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,331
[ominous music playing]

469
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,626
How short?

470
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:39,378
We need 600.

471
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,996
And as of this morning,

472
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:45,083
we had 387 oxygen tanks on hand,

473
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:48,376
with the promise of 220 more
from a regional distributor.

474
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,958
[Cole] But the distributor
had made an error.

475
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,711
There were 20 tanks available.

476
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:54,291
-Not 220.
-[John] Oh.

477
00:27:58,291 --> 00:27:59,921
[Nichols] We're 200 short.

478
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:03,376
Is there nowhere else we can get tanks?

479
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:07,456
Look, at this point, we've exhausted
all the resources in the region.

480
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:09,961
I've, I've spoken to the IndoPac command,

481
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:12,881
and they're broadening the search
to the west coast of the US, but--

482
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:15,828
There's no guarantee
we'll find what we need in time.

483
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:18,076
[Nichols] Everyone is squeezing
as hard as they can,

484
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:22,166
only keeping what they absolutely need
for their business or military needs.

485
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,960
There's just not that much spare capacity
and we're asking for a lot.

486
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,535
We keep pushing forward.

487
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:42,083
With the oxygen tanks taking the priority.

488
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:59,536
[cell phone rings]

489
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:03,788
How was it inside the cave?

490
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,995
[Sam] <i>A lot tougher</i>
<i>than I expected. </i>[sighs]

491
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,253
<i>The path was so narrow</i>

492
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:10,173
<i>I could barely squeeze through</i>
<i>some of those tight turns.</i>

493
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,206
So, when is the next dive?

494
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,170
Uh, I don't have one.
I have a flight in the morning to Bangkok.

495
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:20,133
<i>As soon as I get back,</i>
<i>I'll be able to practice some more, okay?</i>

496
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:23,458
What happened, Sam, huh?
Is Chet sending you home?

497
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,383
<i>Or did Buddy do something?</i>

498
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:27,498
Nothing like that.

499
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,420
It's not in the news yet.

500
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:32,423
There aren't enough oxygen tanks

501
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,080
<i>to complete the rescue.</i>

502
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:40,785
[softly] What?

503
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:44,785
Oh, poor kids.

504
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,750
-Maybe you were right.
-<i>About what?</i>

505
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:50,416
A break.

506
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,705
Those kids could really use a break.

507
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,251
<i>Maybe the boys just have bad luck.</i>

508
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,920
Seeing so many people join forces,

509
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:01,498
I don't want it to end like this.

510
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:06,626
<i>I want those boys saved</i>
<i>as much as you do, but…</i>

511
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,378
more time for us.

512
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,128
I'm happy you're coming home.

513
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,290
Forgot how hard it can be
to manage military life.

514
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:16,288
It's stressing.

515
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:20,041
I really want to come home to you.

516
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:26,003
I know you wanna help the boys though.

517
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:41,501

519
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:54,671

[women talking in Thai]

521
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,883
Hello! Kelly!

522
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:37,503
So glad to see you here.

523
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:40,206
Come taste my khao soi.

524
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,750
Come, try my khao soi.
This is my best cooking.

525
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:52,325
No, I'm not, not very hungry right now.

526
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:55,666
Give it a try first.
It's so very delicious.

527
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,960
[woman laughs]

528
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:57,961
Come on in.

529
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,751
Nid, will you watch my stall
while I talk to my friend?

530
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:01,883
[Nid] Yes, Mae Bua.

531
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,580
Come on in, dear.

532
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:04,916
Come, come, come!

533
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:06,996
Sit, sit.

534
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:09,326
[Bua] Sit here, please.

535
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,253
There.

536
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:13,583
[Bua laughs]

537
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:16,626
My khao soi is the best. [laughs]

538
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:18,916
[Bua] Dig in, dear.

539
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:25,078
I didn't think you would, um…

540
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:28,211
be working out here.

541
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:32,381
[Bua chuckling]
Where else would I go?

542
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:34,665
Mm.

543
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:36,376
I felt like

544
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:38,708
this is my only way to help.

545
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,625
My husband passed away many years ago.

546
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:44,378
My kids are grown up now.

547
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:46,746
I like cooking.

548
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:49,883
If I can't feed them with the rice I grow,

549
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,418
then I'll feed them with khao soi.

550
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:56,245
Yeah, dig in, dear. Eat up.

551
00:32:58,375 --> 00:32:59,375
Go on.

552
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:10,961
[clears throat]

553
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:13,831
It's very good.

554
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,538
[Kelly] Thank you so much.

555
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:19,286
Yes.

556
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,206
I thought you would…

557
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,790
be angry

558
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,495
with… with me now.

559
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:35,458
It hasn't cost me anything
to be here doing this right now.

560
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,375
But…

561
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:42,171
But you gave up all your rice paddies.

562
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:46,166
And now you gave up your time

563
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and…

564
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,883
and you gave your food as well.

565
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:59,536
We can only give up
the things we can afford to lose.

566
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,380
You found my farmland

567
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,293
and knew that it could be useful.

568
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:13,785
And you had the courage
to ask this old lady to sacrifice it.

569
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:19,461
Even though it was your ranger friend
that made the request.

570
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:21,881
Am I right? [chuckles]

571
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,125
I…

572
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,633
I just couldn't ask, myself.

573
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,205
Don't worry about it.

574
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:33,923
That's how it is.

575
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,325
I can give my farm,

576
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,246
and being here helps too.

577
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:40,583
Come on, then.

578
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,963
Eat it all up. [laughs]

579
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,381
Dig in.

580
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,423
Don't be shy. [chuckles]

581
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,500
[soothing music playing]

582
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:02,745
The boy who's swimming
is going to need a tank.

583
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:06,576
But if you do that,
one person in Chamber Nine is…

584
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:07,996
is two tanks short.

585
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:12,961
What if we flip from here to here?

586
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,375
No, that doesn't work either.

587
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,460
Master Sergeant James Nichols?

588
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:25,083
He's Nichols.

589
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:27,078
Delivery for you, sir.

590
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:30,791
Delivery for you.

591
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:53,753
[Nichols] Ask the driver
where these came from.

592
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,923
-Who brought these here?
-I don't know, sir.

593
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:57,536
He doesn't know.

594
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,375
What did you do?

595
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,128
[Nichols] Someone must've
heard our prayers.

596
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,328
I guess the mission's back on, then.

597
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,625
-[Nichols] Load 'em out.
-[Chet] Let's go, let's go!

-[Baitoey] Hey, Tee.
-Hmm?

602

[grunts]

603
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,375
What's wrong?

604
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:48,376
Well, your friend, Aran…

605
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:51,578
Outside he said he saw my father.

606
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:53,746
I choked up.

607
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:56,786
When my mother sent a note to me,

608
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:59,498
I thought my dad was still in Myanmar.

609
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,250
He works in construction there.

610
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:05,541
He can't afford to take time off.

611
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,665
Then I found out

612
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:11,541
he's only here because of his son.

613
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:16,881
As it is now, we barely make ends meet.

[Tee sobs]

615
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,825
We'll probably have to move.

616
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:26,713
It's all because of me.

617
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:30,001
I will probably have to change schools
with my sister.

618
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,078
[sobs] I want to be brave,

619
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:36,956
so I'll be worthy
of my family's sacrifice. [sobbing]

620
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:38,791
But I can't do it.

[sobbing] And Mali…

622
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:45,748
Wait. Mali? Who is that?

623

Aw!

Everyone in the team counts on me.

626
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,791
But I'm letting them down.

627
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:56,915
I'm letting everyone down!

628
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,130
-It's okay.
-I get so mad at myself.

629
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:06,285
I just feel like I can't breathe at all.

-You know…

631

[Chet] Nobody will say
where all these tanks came from.

But my money is on the palace.

644

Funny. I thought I sent you two away.

645
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,826
Yeah, flight leaves tomorrow.

646
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:15,793
I thought we'd be more useful here

in the hotel.

[Chet] Huh. That's good.
