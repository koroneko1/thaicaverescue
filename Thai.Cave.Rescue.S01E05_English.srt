about what his death means

I can assure you, we will not stop.

27

We are not going to give up.
We will keep going.

34
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,245

Safety for the Wild Boars and the rescuers

has always been a priority.

39
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,830
Which is why we are discussing everything

00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,626

[voice quavering] How he died.
It must be terrible.

Here. Drink this. You'll feel better.

50
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,916

[Nick] <i>Do you think your mom is mad, Tle?</i>

Oh yeah. That's an understatement.

I'll never be allowed
to leave the house ever again.

[soldiers assenting politely]

60
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,253
What is this?

61
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,580
We're helping you get through this
without any further disasters, all right?

62
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,713
There is a lot more at stake here, Nong.

63
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,705
[minister] Governor. Please, have a seat.

64
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:18,745
-Hello.
-Hello.

65
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,171
Any news?

66
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,666
The British dive experts
are checking the route

67
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,420
for any new obstructions
that may have caused last night's tragedy.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,750
Apparently, it is not uncommon

69
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,333
for rocks and sand to shift
once a cave begins to flood.

70
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,168
Is that how he died?

71
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,000
We may never know
with certainty what happened in there.

72
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:43,211
But conditions are more treacherous
than any of us anticipated.

73
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,131
-And they're only going to get worse.
-[minister] Agreed.

74
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,208
Once the British
have given us the all-clear to go back in,

75
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,171
we're going to continue the mission.

76
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,000
You can't seriously think
you should continue this mission?

77
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,876
[tutting] As the sun rose,

78
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,536
the entire nation
mourned the loss of a warrior.

79
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,165
One of the best of us.

80
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,920
He succumbed to this monster
and died sacrificing himself.

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,210
How can we send
starved and exhausted children into this

82
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,961
and expect anything other
than the same fate for them, hmm?

83
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,211
I share your concerns.

84
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,631
-Minister.
-[minister] Yes.

85
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,380
The governor has been
keeping me up-to-date

86
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,708
on everything that's been going on here.

87
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,291
In light of this recent tragic death,

88
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,583
we should consider an alternative.

89
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:36,251
A way that simply
keeps the boys alive for the time being.

90
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,290
We can keep them alive.

91
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,455
That should be what matters most
right now in this situation.

92
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,331
You mean inside the cave, right?

93
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,376
[Kiattisak] Yes.

94
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,248
[minister] Won't they run out
of oxygen if they stay in there?

95
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,793
That's why we'll pump in oxygen
from outside the cave.

96
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,875
It's an alternative they once considered
but dismissed early on.

97
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:59,535
Unfortunately, it seems--
I think too hastily sometimes,

98
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:03,955
but right now, we must consider this
as a viable option for those kids.

99
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,331
Is this possible?

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,830
The foreign cave-diving experts

101
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,166
have already laid out
the guideline for us,

102
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,380
in less than a week's time.

103
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,748
It is the same principle
but with an air hose.

104
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,080
And how can we guarantee their safety
for that long inside of the cave?

105
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,916
We know that some of those chambers
flood completely in the monsoon season.

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,130
[Kiattisak] But how can you
guarantee their safety

107
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,168
diving out of there
given all that has happened?

108
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,380
You can't possibly expect those boys
to survive diving out of the cave?

109
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,498
I've already asked
Admiral Appakorn and the Americans

110
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,543
to work on new safety protocols.

111
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,328
Sir, no one wants a repeat of today.

112
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,173
But we can't just abandon a plan
that has some chance of success.

113
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,960
-There are too many variables.
-How can you--

114
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,831
[gasps] That's enough! Listen to me.

115
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,666
[minister sighs]

116
00:07:56,666 --> 00:08:01,166
We've been reminded today
of exactly what is at stake here.

117
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:02,958
Prove yourselves.

118
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,041
Now is the time to do so.

119
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,711
So, find out what exactly it'll take

120
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,751
to ensure the boys
remain alive in the cave.

121
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,791
No detail is too small for this.

122
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,665
And you, discuss your new
safety protocols with your divers.

123
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,710
You have the higher bar to clear
given Ja Sam's death.

124
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,503
I want the both of you,
no matter what it takes,

125
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,043
to exhaust every possible outcome.

126
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,535
So, when this is over,
no one will be able to say

127
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:39,165
we didn't try everything we possibly could
to bring those boys to safety.

128
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,788
I will except no more mistakes.

129
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,376
[Narongsak sighs]

130
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,825
Two days ago,
you wanted them out immediately.

131
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,670
Why the dramatic shift?

132
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,793
What are you after?

133
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,915
Don't be so cynical, Nong.

134
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,251
I just don't want anyone else dying.

135
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,541
Neither do I.

136
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,536
[Kiattisak grumbles]

137
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,041
[footsteps receding]

138
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,750
[Eak] <i>Something has changed.</i>

139
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,423
Tell us what happened.

140
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,790
[Bhak] A SEAL has died,

141
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,995
but I didn't know him
that well personally.

142
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,461
[Baitoey] We were in the same unit
before he retired.

143
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,043
He was an exceptional SEAL.

144
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,706
But he was an even better man.

145
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,711
[solemn music playing]

146
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,630
He would still be alive right now
if I didn't bring the team here.

147
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,001
Is he going to be all right?

148
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,960
Eventually.

149
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,250
When they're all safely out of the cave.

150
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,423
And when he figures out
how to forgive himself.

151
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,168
[Baitoey] Bhak.

152
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,418
I think you should tell him.

153
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,995
The oxygen meter dropped
below 15% this morning.

154
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,883
We are in the danger zone now.

155
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,833
Sam's death has changed the calculations

156
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,996
the higher-ups are making out there, but…

157
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,211
we're gonna get you out of here
as soon as we can.

158
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,291
Keep Eak's spirits up.

159
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,825

[Rick] Four months?

165
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,251
You might as well be telling
those boys we've given up on them!

166
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,173
That's what it's going to feel like
if they're told to wait this thing out

167
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,920
until autumn with an oxygen tube in there.

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,670
What's their plan
if the oxygen tube gets a hole in it?

169
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,420
Or one of the kids gets pneumonia?

170
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,710
How's Dr. Bhak supposed to treat that
in a damp, dark cave?

171
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,081
All we can do is focus
on what's being asked of us,

172
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,626
which boils down to one question.

173
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:17,538
Are we doing everything we can
to guarantee the boys' safety

174
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,745
on the dive out?

175
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,705
We have learned a brutal lesson.

176
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,881
My men are highly skilled divers
out in open water,

177
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,128
but here, we're learning as we go.

178
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,668
So, for the safety of everyone involved,

179
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,456
the rescue itself should be handled
by expert cave divers.

180
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,961
My men will provide all necessary support.

181
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,041
But, sir…

182
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,245
This is an unprecedented mission.

183
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:48,923
We have to adjust our plans
according to the changing circumstances.

184
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,251
-[Narongsak] Are you up for this?
-[murmurs of assent]

185
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,213
Okay, then. What do we do next?

186
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:58,291
So, the biggest threat,
aside from the cave itself, is panic.

187
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,995
Panic is a powerful human reflex.
It's impossible to combat.

188
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,963
We're asking these kids

189
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,751
to dive through tight spaces

190
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,963
filled with sharp objects
in pitch-black, cold water.

191
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,791
[John] For several hours at a time.

192
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,285
It's not a matter of <i>if,</i>
but how long before they panic.

193
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,875
When they do, they will thrash around.

194
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,288
They will endanger the lives
of divers and themselves.

195
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,625
What do you suggest we do
to prevent that from happening?

196
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,578
Oh-- [sighs]

197
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:24,246
If we're going to buddy-swim them out,
we need to restrict their movements.

198
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:29,003
[sighs] When a lifeguard is trying
to save someone from drowning,

199
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,630
they'll swim them out on their back,

200
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,128
immobilizing them--
their arms at the shoulder,

201
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:38,168
but that's not feasible
in spaces this tight or for this long.

202
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,630
Restrict their movement,
you wanna zip-tie their hands?

203
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,378
Behind their backs, ideally.

204
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,498
-Feet too.
-[Chet] Are you insane?

205
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,503
You wanna handcuff children underwater?

206
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,753
The only way we can safely
take them out of the cave

207
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:53,383
is to treat them like the packages
of MREs or the air tanks going in.

208
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,918
They must be fully immobilized.

209
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,130
Even zip-tied, they'll likely
still thrash, panic, stirring up silt.

210
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,328
What if they knock you off the guide rope?

211
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,750
Go ahead. Your idea.

212
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,883
[somber music playing]

213
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,290
What if we anesthetized them?

214
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,916
[solemn silence]

215
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,535
Is this really the plan
from the head of operations?

216
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,455
That's insane!
Get the kids drugged underwater.

217
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,381
Would they do this to their own children?

218
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,288
Chet!

219
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,501
You're out of line.

220
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,376
[softly] Hey, man. Let's go for a walk.

221
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:43,288
[Rick] No one <i>wants</i> to do it,
but short of a better idea,

222
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,875
I can't see how else we can prevent them
from panicking for long enough

223
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:48,881
to save their lives.

224
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,710
Say we did go down this path,

225
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,458
how would you do it?

226
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,205
Which one of you is the doctor?

227
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,961
-[Rick scoffs under breath]
-None of us are doctors.

228
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,750
James and some of the other
pararescue jumpers

229
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,583
have experience in combat medicine.

230
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:14,326
But not with children underwater
in a high-altitude cave.

231
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:18,206
I don't even know if it's realistic,
but I know someone who will.

232
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,668
Richard Harris.

233
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,131
Dr. Harry.

234
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:25,538
He's an Australian cave diver,
but he's also an anesthetist.

235
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,205
Only one in the world, as far as we know.

236
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,878
[man] You actually got them
to agree to this insane scheme?

237
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,576
[John over phone] <i>Not exactly.</i>

238
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,416
<i>They're open to it,</i>
<i>but they'll need some convincing.</i>

239
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,630
Yes, well…
Reckon I'll need some convincing as well.

240
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:52,081
Well, aren't you Wet Mules
always whinging in your blog

241
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,706
about wanting to find
unique solutions for unique problems?

242
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,831
This is about as unique as it comes.
This is a bloody unicorn.

243
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,416
Better not let Craig
hear you call it a "blog."

244
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,630
He didn't!

245
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,830
[Craig chuckles]

246
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,673
I dunno. What you're asking's never been
done before, and for good reason.

247
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,790
Even if I could work out the logistics,
there's medical ethics.

248
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,326
And also,

249
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,710
I can't do this without a partner I trust.
I don't move without Craig.

250
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,580
Dr. Harris.

251
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,206
<i>That's my father's name.</i>

252
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,745
Harry, I'm not sure
we can get approval fast enough.

253
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,633
<i>Your embassy said</i>
<i>you were pre-vetted through AUSMAT,</i>

254
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:32,918
<i>so it was an easy ask of Canberra,</i>
<i>but Craig will be a tougher sell.</i>

255
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,210
Major, with respect,

256
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,535
I don't move without Craig.

257
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,996
Okay, let me see what I can do.

258
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,375
[thunder rumbling]

259
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,880
[Kelly] Thankfully, there's more good news
than bad news.

260
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,785
[Kiattisak] How do you mean?

261
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,326
Because we've tried so many ways
to clear water out of the cave,

262
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:04,246
we've got at least 30 different types
of pipes and hoses out there right now.

263
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,333
[officer whispering]

264
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,376
[Kiattisak] You can make this work?

265
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:13,498
Since some are of different sizes,
we'll have to jury-rig them together.

266
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,880
Can your team start immediately?

267
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,498
There are still
some calculations to be done.

268
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,173
I've posted some of the problem sets
on Facebook and Reddit.

269
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,380
On Facebook?

270
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,628
[Pim] Sir, engineers
from around the world are watching.

271
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:31,081
Crowdsourcing some of the best minds
out there can really speed up the process.

272
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:35,036
Using good calculations,
some of the materials can be ruled out.

273
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,418
While that's being done,
I'm gonna start with the practical tests.

274
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,880
The maps don't do justice
to the trickiest bits.

275
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,538
Some things we won't know
until we get in there and measure it.

276
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,535
[whispering]

277
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:49,458
Minister, sir, we are currently
working with a team of Americans

278
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,081
to determine how many
additional MREs we'll need

279
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,786
to keep the boys fed
for the next few months,

280
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,745
as well as how long it will take
to get supplies into the cave--

281
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,543
Hi, excuse the interruption.

282
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,328
I'm looking for a forest ranger named Pim.

283
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,876
[Kiattisak] And who are you exactly?

284
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,326
I'm Noon from the TMD in Bangkok.

285
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,576
Noon, hi.

286
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:14,083
[Noon] I couldn't take it anymore.
Today the satellite went down again.

287
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,286
The same one that went down
when this all started.

288
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:20,415
So I came here. I had to do something.
Especially for Ja Sam.

289
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,580
Wait. What are you doing here?

290
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:26,166
I'm gonna set up a mobile weather station
at the top of Pha Mee mountain.

291
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,330
That boss of mine
didn't want me to come here.

292
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,666
He said the satellite would be up again.

293
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,380
But after what happened last time,
I was able to convince him

294
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,458
that if anyone found out
we could've helped and didn't try,

295
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,291
it would be
a career-ending kind of scandal.

296
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,330
I think that part is what got to him.

297
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,080
Pim, I was hoping
you could help me out with this.

298
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,955
I'm in the middle of strategizing.

299
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,131
All of the strategizing in the world

300
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,668
isn't going to help
if the weather changes on us.

301
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,955
It's too late to leave now.
I think we should talk to the governor.

302
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,131

has a friend at the US Embassy.

might injure herself in the jungle.

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,380
[thunder rumbling]

340
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,920
-[SEAL 1] Okay, follow him.
-[SEAL 2] Yes, sir.

341
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,130
[SEAL 1] Watch your step.

342
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,916
[James talking indistinctly]

343
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,211
Everyone!

344
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,881
Anesthetist extraordinaire Dr. Harry

345
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,958
and his dive buddy, Craig.

346
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,381
Veterinarian extraordinaire.

347
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,251
[Narongsak] We are grateful
that you're here.

348
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,423
You'll forgive us
if we do not waste time. Please.

349
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,923
Each of these colors
represents a chamber inside the cave.

350
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,326
Between them are the submerged sumps.

351
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,326
The boys are here in chamber 9.

352
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,538
With four SEALs,
one of them's a doctor who says

353
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:24,995
they're in relatively good health.

354
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,583
The way we've worked it out
is each of the Wild Boars

355
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,916
will be assigned two divers
to swim him out of each submerged sump.

356
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,290
-[Craig] You don't wanna use two divers.
-Why not?

357
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,575
A couple of years ago,
a friend of ours, uh,

358
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,746
a young diver called Agnes,
went missing during a dive,

359
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,173
and Harry and I handled the recovery.

360
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:47,706
We almost found out firsthand
why two divers is a bad idea.

361
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:51,171
If you think about it,
if the lead diver gets jammed up,

362
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,790
there's no way of communicating

363
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,995
with the guy behind him
that he's in trouble.

364
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,673
If you get stuck in a tight spot,

365
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,290
the diver behind you
is pressing forward with a body,

366
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,165
no one knows what the hell's going on--

367
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,290
Someone is going
to get hurt or worse, right?

368
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:06,883
[James] Okay.

369
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,168
So, to help the solo diver,

370
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,540
we'll position the other divers
throughout the cave with SKEDs

371
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,285
to pull the boys out of the water

372
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,745
and carry them
through the chambers between sumps.

373
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,963
We've been trying to find a way
to secure the regulator in the mouth.

374
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,381
[Charles] We suggested
looking into full face masks.

375
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,378
We were able to find
a few of these down south.

376
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,328
So far, all I've heard is the ways
you're setting my friend up here

377
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,876
to send 12 boys to a watery grave.

378
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,038
May I?

379
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:42,383
The only way this works
is with positive-pressure masks.

380
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,748
We looked into those.
They don't make 'em small enough.

381
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,213
[Craig] There's gotta be one
for a small adult

382
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,711
or a teenager
somewhere out there that'd work.

383
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:53,578
What's the difference
with a positive-pressure mask?

384
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:56,326
[Craig] Diving requires
the active participation of the diver,

385
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,956
so you've gotta keep the regulator
in your mouth in order to breathe--

386
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:03,541
If these boys are unconscious,
they won't be breathing regularly.

387
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,245
They sure as hell won't be able
to keep a regulator in their mouth

388
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,713
or notice water coming in.

389
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,540
And neither will the diver
that's pulling them through. So…

390
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:13,581
They'll drown.

391
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:20,036
But a positive-pressure mask,
we've worked with them in the States,

392
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,285
the air is flowing,

393
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,785
pressurized air coming in no matter what.

394
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,665
Only way these boys
have a fighting chance.

395
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:28,631
And if we can't find the masks?

396
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,825
Well, then Craig's right.

397
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:33,286
I can't anesthetize them.

398
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:35,251
They will drown.

399
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,460
But if we can find a mask small enough,

400
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:48,171
and we're able to ballast the boys
level and face down in the water--

401
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,000
Wait, why face down?

402
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:53,583
So they don't obstruct their airways,
don't choke on their own tongue,

403
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,076
drown in their own saliva.

404
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:56,918
There is a chance

405
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,380
if we can get the masks.

406
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,791
Okay. We got our marching orders.

407
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:11,883
[James] So Chet is working with Kelly
and Jirasak to try and pipe in oxygen?

408
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:12,788
[Aran] Yeah.

409
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,333
Yeah, well he's taking Sam's death hard.

410
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:20,668
Yeah. You know, Chet and Ja Sam,
they'd known each other a long time.

411
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,498
He wants a chance to make it right.

412
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,083
Okay. Please, start it up!

413
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:38,038
[engine starts]

414
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:41,665
The compressor pushes the air
down the hose, up through this tank here.

415
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:43,708
[air hissing]

416
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:46,671
[Kelly] The tank will be filled with water
to catch any leaks.

417
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,710
The engineer, he's got the air-out end.

418
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:51,376
[Chet] This seems like a thorough plan.

419
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,423
If it's working, how will we know that?

420
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,078
[Chet] Yes, how will we know if it leaks?

421
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,746
The water will fill up
with air bubbles at the junction.

422
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,375
[Chet] That's true, if there's a leak,
air bubbles come out here.

423
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,458
[compressor whirring]

424
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:20,998
[Harry] <i>Look, you have to</i>
<i>trust me on this.</i>

425
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:23,383
They'll be fully conscious underwater<i>,</i>

426
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:26,708
in the pitch black for hours
without control over their bodies.

427
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,211
Would <i>you</i> like to experience
that type of torture?

428
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:34,131
He says using muscle relaxants can be
torture and too dangerous for the boys.

429
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,418
[doctor] <i>Maybe we should</i>
<i>revisit Midazolam.</i>

430
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,460
Or maybe Lorazepam.

431
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:39,631
[Harry] Yes-- [sighs]

432
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:41,578
As I explained before,

433
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,036
I'm really not comfortable
with either of those.

434
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,785
They're too, um, unpredictable.

435
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,875
We really should
lean into Dr. Harris's plan.

436
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,578
Ketamine is the way to go.

437
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:54,536
It's reliable, and it won't lower
core body temperature,

438
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:58,165
and in turn, means that it won't
lower blood pressure on the dive.

439
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,956
Ketamine truly does seem
like the least harmful option,

440
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:02,881
and it won't mess with their vitals.

441
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,790
[doctor 2] But it doesn't last very long.

442
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,535
If they wake up during the dive,
what would you do with them?

443
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,503
That's a good point.

444
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:14,043
What <i>would</i> you do
if they wake up during the dive?

445
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:20,625
Uh, the diver taking them out
will have to jab them again.

446
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,125
[Narongsak] Leave them in

447
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:28,745
or take them out.

448
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:33,383
We should ask their parents
what they think.

449
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,035
[Kiattisak] We're the leaders.

450
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:43,245
Now we have to decide
what to do with them.

451
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:49,461
Those people there,
there are no divers among them.

452
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,785
No engineers with them.

453
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:55,626
Plus, they're emotional
and mentally drained.

454
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,923
Ask yourself, if your daughter
was in a cave,

455
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,963
could you handle
the situation objectively?

456
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:07,881
I don't know.

457
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:14,173
But tell me,
wouldn't you want a say in all of this?

458
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,791
[thunder rumbles]

459
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:29,126
-[man 1] How long have you been in for?
[man 2] The Air Force? Ten years.

460
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,785
-Ever seen anything like this?
Nope.

461
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:38,083
[Harry] <i>Tell me we found some masks.</i>

462
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:42,996
The Yanks managed to pull four custom,
extra-small positive-pressure masks

463
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,333
out of their arses.

464
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:48,376
They sent a transport all the way
to God knows where to pick them up.

465
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,418
They sent a whole plane for four masks?

466
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,750
Hey, mate, it's not my hard-earned
Australian tax dollars at work.

467
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,790
Oh, and the SEALs, uh,
got the SKEDs together too.

468
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,625
They're setting up
a dry run at a pool nearby.

469
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,830
So a wet run, then?

470
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:04,288
No, that's not what that means.

471
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:05,205
A wet run--

472
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:08,041
Are you gonna tell me
what happened in there or not?

473
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:11,246
Look, they're rightly nervous
about all of this.

474
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:15,041
But they wanna dictate
every aspect of the process.

475
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:16,955
The medicine, the dosage, all of it.

476
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:21,246
You're the guy that's gonna be
inside the cave doling it out.

477
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,463
Not much they can do
to stop you doing it your way--

478
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:24,381
Craig.

479
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:27,535
What happens when one of those boys dies?

480
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,540
Because we both know that's gonna happen.
How do I explain myself?

481
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,825
I'm a murderer on foreign soil.
You're an accessory.

482
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:37,246
We both end up
in a Bangkok prison. It's true.

483
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:40,043
No, no. That's when I get
Toe here to smuggle me out.

484
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,881
I've been told not to listen
to anything you say.

485
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:46,628
[Craig] And that is good advice.
You're a quick study.

486
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:49,876
So are we just gonna walk away?

487
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,080
I need to see these boys for myself.

488
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,038
[James] This what you want too?

489
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:01,131
[Craig] It's not about what I want.
I move with Harry.

490
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,415
[Harry] If they are
going to be my patients,

491
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,170
I surely have the right
to examine them myself.

492
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:10,080
I don't know. You'd be better off
running practice drills in a pool with us.

493
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,286
This whole exercise might be moot

494
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,785
if I get in there
and decide they're not up to it.

495
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:17,035
[Rick] Have you thought about
what it's going to be like

496
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:18,875
to swim away from these boys

497
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,208
knowing you could be
leaving them there to die?

498
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,705
[Phong's grandma]
<i>Those are our only options?</i>

499
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,420
If they were your children,

500
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:32,286
would you risk their lives
during the rescue

501
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:35,331
or risk their lives inside the cave?

502
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,171
Both options are risky, yes.

503
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,000
Of course they are. But what would <i>you</i> do?

504
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,040
I'd rescue them.

505
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:44,963
[Namhom] Why is that?

506
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:50,041
For a dangerous situation like this,

507
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,831
it's about choosing between a quick death

508
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,165
and a slow one.

509
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,883
But this is not my decision.

510
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:07,666
Thank you, Governor.

511
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,673
I appreciate your honesty.

512
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,671
I feel the same way.

513
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,708
[Narongsak] If you're willing
to give your consent,

514
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:23,746
I need you to sign a release form,

515
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,208
so that we can proceed.

516
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:31,541
We need the boy's name,
the guardian's name,

517
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,205
and your signature here.

518
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,075
One per family.

[women sobbing]

521
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:07,458
I will not!

522
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,790
You think you know
what it feels like to have a dead child!

523
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:13,375
But I promise you, you have no idea!

524
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,043
And I will not sign!

525
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,995
I'm telling you now,

526
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:20,673
no person is going to make me
give up on my Tle!

527
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:23,791

[Biw's dad] Sak!

530
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:55,166
You look lost!

531
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:00,043
-[Sak] I'm giving my wife some space.
-[Biw's dad] Come, take a seat.

532
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,165
We can take a break
from our wives together.

533
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,421
[Thai song playing softly on radio]

537
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:41,708
-It's… It's Biw's favorite song.
-[Sak] Mm, Tle too.

538
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:46,083
I always turn the volume up
whenever it comes on

539
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:47,826
just to tease him a little.

540
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,670
I was out the night before.

541
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:55,423
The night before they went into the cave.

542
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,001
But I stopped by the soccer field.

543
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:03,035
I wasn't sure if Biw wanted me
to see him there practicing.

544
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,375
Kids get easily embarrassed at there age.

545
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:11,383
When all this is over…

546
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,290
Then… And when Biw comes home to me…

547
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,625
I promise to be a better father.

Before Tle…

551
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:40,078
we had a younger daughter.

552
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:46,998
Then, one day, she got really sick.

553
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:50,793
It was terminal.

554
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:55,628
I never knew about your daughter.

555
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,375
My condolences.

556
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:01,291
At the time…

557
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,543
we didn't think we could recover.

558
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:11,126
Then we had Tle.

559
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,461
Our hearts were flooded with love again.

00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:17,875
[poignant music playing]

561
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:22,708
We swore an oath.

562
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:25,831
We would keep him safe anyway we could.

563
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:33,205
But we have no control over this.
Trust me, we're all trying.

564
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:36,001
I believe that. I believe that.

565

567
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:49,751
[Biw] Hey, you're cheating!

568
00:34:50,666 --> 00:34:53,456
What a noop. Two against one
and you <i>still</i> lost everything.

569
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:54,961
-[Night] One more game?
-[Adul] Sure.

570
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:57,291
-[Biw] Let's try again. Catch it.
-[Mark coughing]

571
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,213
[Nick] Coach Eak,

572
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:10,921
we're really sorry.

573
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,170
We all forgot how dangerous it is in here.

574
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,380
Because you've protected us from danger.

575
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,793
So we let our guard down for a time.

576
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:39,003
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

577
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,080
I wasn't mad at you.

578
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:43,963
I'm not mad at any of you.

579
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,251
[poignant music playing]

580
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,713
I'm mad at myself.

581
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:54,041
I'm really sorry.

582
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:59,036
[voice quavers]
I'm sorry for bringing you here

583
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,541
and putting you through all of this.

584
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:04,921
You don't deserve any of this. [sniffs]

585
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,960
You're just kids.
You know, you should be playing pranks,

586
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,460
having fun, enjoying life,

587
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:15,041
and not worrying about being here.

588
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,251
None of this is your fault, Eak.

589
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,670
You didn't force anybody to be here.

590
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,170
We wanted to be here. All of us.

591
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,673
Although, I didn't want to…

592
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,920
[Eak chuckles softly]

593
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,210
…you never forced me
to come with you, Eak.

594
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:38,078
I may not have forced you to be here…

595
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:43,128
but I led the way,
and then you followed me.

596
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,080
I am the coach.

597
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,081
I am supposed to protect you.

598
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:55,001
If anything happened to any of you…

599
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:03,883
[Tle] You don't have to
protect us anymore.

600
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,920
Because you taught us how to stay alive.

601
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:19,625
-[James] What's your name, kid?
-Can you tell my friend here your name?

602
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,038
Uh, Boon-Nam.

603
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:23,075
[Aran] 'Boon-Nam' means good fortune.

604
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:25,956
He's a Wild Boar who was supposed to
go into the cave with them,

605
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:28,041
but his mom called him home early.

606
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:30,165
All right, this is gonna be really weird,

607
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,920
but I'm gonna need you
to put your hands together like this.

608
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,380
-[Aran] Cross your arms behind your back.
-Well… will this help my friends?

609
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:41,415
[James] Yes, sir.

[Rick] We need
some sort of buoyancy for the legs.

614
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:49,828
It'd need to be something already
in the cave. We can't take more things in.

615
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:50,916
[Rick] Yeah.

616
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,880
How about this?

617
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,376
[Boon-nam breathing erratically]

[Boon-nam yelling]

619
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,536
-Is it over?
-Hey. It's okay, kid. You did really well.

620
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:34,211
-[Boon-nam] Where's my mom?
-[James] You're okay.

621
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:36,791
Where did she go?
I can't do it again. [crying]

622
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:47,495
[Harry] Okay, big breath in.

623
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,133
You gotta inhale, Mark.

624
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:51,208
-[Mark inhales deeply]
-[Harry] And out.

625
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:52,501
And now breathe out.

626
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:55,076
[Mark coughing]

627
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,576
Okay. Once more.

628
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:57,746
[Adul] One more time.

629
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:59,293
[Mark inhales deeply]

630
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,666
[deep cough]

631
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,380
Okay. Okay. Thank you, young man.

632
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:09,165
You take it easy, okay? Thank you, Adul.

633
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:11,206
[Mark coughing]

634
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,420
Look, he's not great.
He'll need treatment on the outside.

635
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:24,496
But generally, I can't believe
how healthy you've kept them all in here.

636
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,583
I can't take much credit. They're tough.

637
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:31,788
Hey, Adul. Maybe he has
a pet kangaroo or something.

638
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:33,955
Do you have a pet kangaroo?

639
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:35,501
[giggling] A kangaroo?

640
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:36,793
All Australians do.

641
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:38,285
They all have kangaroos!

642
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,875
-Everyone, really?
-[Adul] Do you really?

643
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:42,458
[everyone laughing]

644
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:44,461
When do you plan to take them out?

645
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:46,961
They're still deciding that, I'm afraid.

646
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:48,881
[Bhak] I know they're doing their best,

647
00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:51,038
but the sooner
they make a decision, the better.

648
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:54,955
These kids are resilient,
more than most adults I know,

649
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:58,631
but the stress of not knowing
will wear anyone down eventually.

650
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,500
[boys laughing happily]

651
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:05,133
When I get out of here,
I will ask for a kangaroo.

[voice quavering] I pray for the courage
to endure this life's trial.

655
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:53,173
But there's none to be found. [sobbing]

outlive their babies. [sobbing]

This…

658
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:05,793
This pain is excruciating.

to stay strong for my baby boy.

660
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:15,173

665
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:40,708
[Noon] Stop asking me that!
I'm trying to figure it out!

666
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:45,461
It will be bad!

667
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:48,291
It's almost 40 millimeters
and still rising.

such bad luck with satellites?

[tense music playing]

677
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:41,958
[Kiattisak] I understand clearly, right?

678
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:43,788
The hose isn't leaking,

679
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:46,745
and the air is flowing
all the way through the system.

680
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,920
Your test really worked. You did it.

681
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:56,960
Yes, but this is a dry run.
It works every time we try it out here.

682
00:43:57,041 --> 00:44:00,381
But both times that we've tried it
in chamber 1, it springs a leak.

683
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:03,828
The strength of the current
and wear and tear of the rope.

684
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:05,456
This is only a test, sir.

685
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:09,291
The system works out here on dry land,
but it always leaks inside the cave.

686
00:44:09,791 --> 00:44:11,881
It's because of the extra water pressure.

687
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,080
Well, can you fix it or can't you?

688
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:18,246
Yes, sir. But we need more time.

689
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:20,713
More tests need to be conducted.

690
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:25,500
We need to be sure
that when more flood and rain comes,

691
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:28,713
and it will, that our system
can withstand the pressure.

692
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:32,041
Preparedness is key
for when the next severe storm comes.

693
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:35,501
What do you think, Chet?

694
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:40,211
You, and you alone, are the only one
who has dived in that cave.

695
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:47,753
Do you agree with the two of them?

696
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:49,583
Do you agree we need more time?

697
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:51,963
Or we have to run even more tests?

698
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:01,331
Yes, sir. We need more time.

699
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,460
But we will not fail.

700
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:07,923
Okay.

701
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:17,171
[Narongsak] There's nothing I can do
unless you all sign the document.

702
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,790
They will never leave
some of the boys in and bring some out.

703
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:21,745
It's too risky.

704
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:25,001
You either all take part…

705
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:29,748
or we're already beaten.

706
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:33,125
You asked us to come,

707
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:35,288
to sign away our sons' lives.

708
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,500
[somber silence]

709
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,170
Hey, where've you been?

710
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,670
I was worried about you.

711
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,130
Praying at the temple.

712
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:51,788
I was asked about Kisa Gotami.

713
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:52,785
[Sak] Kisa?

714
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,670
The parable.

715
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:57,080
The monk couldn't believe
I hadn't heard of it.

716
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:01,833
[poignant music playing]

717
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:06,543
When her child died…

718
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:10,173
she was heartbroken.

719
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:15,133
People say she lost her mind with grief.

720
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:18,633
And so she goes to the Buddha,
who tells her that

721
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:22,418
if she collects mustard seeds
in the village from just one family

722
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,170
who has not experienced death,

723
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:28,456
then he will bring
her child back from the dead.

724
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,080
You know, she goes to every single house,

725
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:43,535
one by one,

726
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:51,246
but everyone has lost someone they loved.

727
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:54,536
Whether it's a son,

728
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:56,131
a father,

729
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:58,038
an uncle,

730
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:00,171
an aunt,

731
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:01,923
or

732
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:05,125
a daughter.

733
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,330
[Phong's grandma] And she realized that

734
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:15,286
there is no house untouched by death.

735
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:20,463
And so Buddha welcomed her return
to hear how she had done.

736
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:24,633
Aware now, she was wiser and humble.

737
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:27,705
She told others about her child.

738
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:31,253
Soothing her pain by sharing with us all.

739
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:36,631
I've already buried a daughter.
[inhales shakily]

740
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:42,543
If there's a chance that signing this
will save other children,

741
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:43,881
I will do it.

742
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,210
I'm willing to sign it.

743
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:50,328
I know that I'm not alone.

744
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:51,286
[inhales shakily]

745
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:01,875
[haunting music playing]

746
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:19,205
May I, sir?

747
00:48:26,958 --> 00:48:28,958
[haunting music continues]

748
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:32,958
[parents mumbling sadly]

749
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,170
[Craig] They're gonna ask us
as soon as we get in that tent.

750
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,380
[Harry] Course they are.

751
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:46,035
I know you wanna help.
It's your nature. You're a bloody saint.

752
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:48,165
[Harry scoffs] Piss off, would you?

753
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:52,881
We both know that's why I'm here.
To play devil on your shoulder.

754
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:57,415
If you go through with this
and even one boy dies…

755
00:48:58,083 --> 00:48:59,133
or a diver…

756
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:02,671
Agnes was bad enough,
we lost a friend, but

757
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:04,666
she was an adult,

758
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:06,541
not some kid you drugged.

759
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:10,753
If you can't live with that
for the rest of your life, don't say yes.

760
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,710
No one's gonna judge you for that.

761
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:24,076
[Narongsak] <i>I have</i>
<i>all the guardians' approval.</i>

762
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:25,786
<i>Do you have everything you need, then?</i>

763
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:29,375
-Only one thing outstanding.
-[John] And it's not insubstantial.

764
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:32,078
Whether or not
Dr. Harris will go through with it.

765
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:33,286
What do you think?

766
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:37,785
Well, if he doesn't, then the boys
have no chance of being rescued.

767
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,630
The way Boon-Nam
was thrashing in the pool,

768
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:43,378
they'll panic at some point
and kill their diver and themselves.

769
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:44,458
[John] He's right.

770
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:45,381
[Noon] Governor!

771
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:47,963
There's a storm coming.

772
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:50,081
One of the largest yet.

773
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:53,286
Nothing can hold it back.
It's a tremendous amount of water.

774
00:49:55,041 --> 00:49:59,131
[typing] We should be in the middle
of the storm, by this time tomorrow.

775
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:02,248
Forty-eight hours from now,
the pumps will most likely fail.

776
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,665
A new storm is coming,
and the pumps won't hold.

777
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,000
[people murmuring]

778
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:09,333
If the pumps go, that's it for diving,

779
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:11,206
with or without Harry.

780
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:16,921
What are the other options?

781
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:19,463
We're out of options.

782
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,213
[somber silence]

783
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:30,538
If I <i>am</i> to do this,

784
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:35,380
I need to be in charge
of my own patients' care.

785
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:40,125
-Everyone needs to sign off on that.
-Okay. We will.

786
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,205
Okay.

787
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:49,173
I'm all in.

788
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,960
-[all] Yes!
-[Rick] Okay!

789
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:53,205
Took you long enough.

790
00:50:57,291 --> 00:51:00,081
[Kiattisak] <i>My team</i>
<i>has made significant progress.</i>

791
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:05,825
[minister] What's this?

792
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:12,751
I appreciate the valiant efforts
of your team,

793
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:16,043
but after speaking with Kiattisak,
I'm inclined to agree

794
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:20,205
that a slow, steady, and safe approach
<i>is </i>the way to go here.

795
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:22,328
We are out of time.

796
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,633
That is no longer possible.

797
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:28,128
There's no time to run the oxygen hose
all the way through the cave.

798
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:30,998
Why? What's changed? Tell us.

799
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:34,213
Please, minister, we have to launch
the operation right away.

800
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,455
Or we will never reach the kids.

801
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:39,830
Noon.

802
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:44,130
She has her boss on.
Listen before we resume.

803
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:47,458
The same type of storm
that trapped them is coming back.

804
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:49,631
It's going to be stronger than before.

805
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:52,668
It's coming off the Indian Ocean
and picking up strength.

806
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:56,915
It won't just lock the boys
and the SEALs inside the cave,

807
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,670
it may drown them altogether.

808
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,250
It will take months
for the water to recede.

809
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:03,713
We'll have no idea
what happened inside until then.

810
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:08,541
Listen. How can you be sure
this storm will be so severe?

811
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,830
<i>Hello, minister.</i>

812
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:15,376
<i>We had the foresight</i>
<i>to install a weather station</i>

813
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:17,248
<i>in the mountains at Doi Pha Mee.</i>

814
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:18,583
<i>I can confirm.</i>

815
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:24,248
Minister, we all wanted the safest route.

816
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:30,786
In fact, I always hoped
your plan would win out in the end.

817
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:34,745
I don't want to see those boys suffer
the way Petty Officer Sam did.

818
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:37,246
That kind of grief,

819
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,750
probably would destroy me.

820
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:45,208
But the circumstances have shifted again.

821
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:49,333
We are working
at the whim of forces greater than us.

822
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,786
We can either bend

823
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:52,455
or break.

824
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:57,791
[minister sighs]

825
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:00,293
What is your idea?

826
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,580
[Narongsak] Master Sergeant, please.

827
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:07,038
We have a series of complex problems

828
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:10,075
we've broken down into manageable
and surmountable chunks.

829
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:12,583
[poignant Thai music playing]

830
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:19,211
What kind of drugs will you use?

831
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:21,581
[Harry] Uh, Ketamine for sedation.

832
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:23,496
I'll administer that myself.

833
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:27,753
And once the diver and boy have gone
through the first sump into chamber 8,

834
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:32,503
my colleague Craig will be waiting
to assess the boy and his breathing.

835
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:35,833
All things going well,
we will proceed with the next boy.

836
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:39,631
What do you estimate
is the chance of success?

837
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,500
Uh…

838
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:47,416
Minister.

839
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:52,825
It's impossible to guarantee 100% success.

840
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:58,330
We have to let go of our grief,
our desperation for complete success.

841
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:00,536
We are all grieving.

842
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:02,995
We are all haunted by Ja Sam's death.

843
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:12,126
But we have to take a risk again.

844
00:54:19,791 --> 00:54:21,291
Seventy-five percent.

845
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:27,583
Fifty percent.

846
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:31,881
Thirty percent.

847
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:34,711
We will lose two-thirds,

848
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:38,251
and most likely it's going to be
the smallest kids that won't make it.

849
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:41,583
[poignant Thai music continues]

850
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,420
If we do nothing,

851
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:48,785
the chance of death is…

852
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:50,495
[Kiattisak] …close to 100%.

853
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,830
I'll be the first to bend.

854
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:04,166
At the very least,

855
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:06,423
these families

856
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,540
deserve to bury their sons.

857
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:14,501
We should not let them drown in the cave.

858
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:18,751
Either way, I don't like it,
but this is the plan.

859
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:33,751
[exhales deeply]

860
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,290
Minister.

861
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:42,963
Six days ago,

862
00:55:43,666 --> 00:55:45,996
I asked the team here
to believe in these boys.

863
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
To see this through.

864
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:54,170
Even though for ten days
the boys had no food or water.

865
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:58,376
At that moment,
a lot of people around here

866
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:02,581
believed that those boys
could not have survived.

867
00:56:05,291 --> 00:56:06,291
But they still live.

868
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,375
[music brightens]

869
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,463
They will survive this also.

870
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:17,326
Their parents and guardians
have signed the release for the dive

871
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,285
despite knowing the risks involved.

872
00:56:23,958 --> 00:56:26,208
Those brave kids have trusted all of us.

873
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:33,748
[voice quavers] We must have trust
in ourselves so they can survive this.

874
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:36,250
[poignant music continues]

875
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:41,038
[minister inhales and exhales deeply]

876
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:47,833
You, you, you, you, and you,

877
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:48,876
please join me.

878
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,130
[phone rings]

879
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:04,171
Hello, sir. I have something
you need to hear.

880
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,040
Yes.

881
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:10,581
Repeat what you just said.

882
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:11,666
All of it.

883
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:13,750
[dissonant music playing]

884
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:19,205
[button clicks]

885
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:23,883
This is Master Sergeant James Nichols
of United States Air Force.

886
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:27,205
I have my commanding officer,
Major Charles Hensen,

887
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:29,291
Governor Narongsak, Admiral Appakorn,

888
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:31,205
and Dr. Richard Harris here with me.

889
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:33,538
Here is the mission brief.

890
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:37,745
We have a series of complex problems

891
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:41,333
we've broken down into manageable
and surmountable chunks.

892
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,626
-[Craig] He's gonna send us home…
-[door opens]

893
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:44,828
…so maybe that was it.

894
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:01,165
It's a green light.

895
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,290
[tense music playing]

896
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:07,751
Our mission to rescue the Wild Boars

897
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:10,251
begins now.

898
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:11,583
[dramatic drums play]

899
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,750
